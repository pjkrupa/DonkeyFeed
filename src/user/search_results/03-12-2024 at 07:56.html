                                    <h3>What to expect at Microsoft’s March 21 event</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-at-microsofts-march-21-event-204559003.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-at-microsofts-march-21-event-204559003.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>Microsoft is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-announces-a-surface-and-windows-ai-event-for-march-21-130447407.html">holding a digital event</a> titled “Advancing the new era of work with Copilot” on March 21. Among the possible announcements are new Surface devices, potentially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-may-debut-its-first-ai-pcs-later-this-month-204522580.html">the first branded as AI PCs</a>. It will already be the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/everything-microsoft-announced-at-its-surface-and-ai-event-171043141.html">second Windows hardware event</a> — and first mainline Surface Pro launch — without former chief product officer and longtime keynote presenter Panos Panay, who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-panos-panay-leaves-company-after-nearly-20-years-153513258.html">left for Amazon last year</a>. Here’s everything we could see at the company's first launch event of 2024.</p>
<p>The company <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://modernworkannounce.event.microsoft.com/">describes</a> the event as breaking down “the latest in scaling AI in your environment with Copilot, Windows, and Surface.” There are conflicting reports about exactly what we’ll see in late March.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Windows Central</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/surface/exclusive-microsoft-will-unveil-oled-surface-pro-10-and-arm-surface-laptop-6-this-month-ahead-of-major-windows-11-ai-update">claims</a> an OLED Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 will headline the event, with their upgraded processors enabling “huge performance and efficiency gains” over their predecessors. However, a report from <em>The Verge</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091211/microsoft-surface-pro-10-surface-laptop-6-release-date-specs">suggests</a> this month’s event will only cover the business and commercial-focused versions of the devices — with much subtler upgrades than the consumer versions. The outlet claims the consumer variants with “a larger redesign” will follow later this spring.</p>
<p>The new devices will allegedly be powered by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-unveils-core-ultra-its-first-chips-with-npus-for-ai-work-150021289.html">Intel Core Ultra</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-snapdragon-x-elite-is-qualcomms-most-powerful-chip-to-date-190004830.html">Snapdragon X Elite</a> silicon with next-generation neural processing units (NPUs) for advanced AI tasks. The Intel variants are expected to launch in April, while the Arm-based Snapdragon ones will reportedly arrive several months later in June. If the reports are accurate, this would be the first time the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-laptop-5-13-inch-review-specs-price-a-beautiful-design-thats-almost-run-its-course-153049819.html">Surface Laptop line</a> has included an Arm-based version.</p>
<p>At least in the consumer models, the Surface Pro 10 is rumored to switch from LCD to an anti-reflective OLED screen. The device would be brighter than the Surface Pro 9’s screen and support HDR content. Meanwhile, the Surface Laptop 6 is rumored to include thinner display bezels (with rounded corners) and a haptic touchpad. Its updated port selection is said to include two USB-C and one USB-A on its left side.</p>
<p>The commercial / business models (which may be all we see at this month’s event) are rumored to include a built-in Common Access Card (CAC) reader and options with up to 64GB of RAM.</p>
<figure><img alt="Image of a Windows keyboard with a dedicated Copilot AI key between the left arrow and Alt keys." src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/67177410-dfe1-11ee-93ef-b73f8b5224ff" style="height: 1080px; width: 1800px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure>
<p>Whether at this month’s event or later, the new consumer-facing Surface Pro and Surface Laptop are expected to kick off Microsoft’s push for Windows 11-running AI PCs. They’ll reportedly be among the first to include an on-device version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-copilot-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-companys-ai-assistant-130004909.html">Copilot</a>. Other rumored AI features include real-time captioning and translation, upscaling and frame-rate smoothing for games, upgraded Windows Studio Effects and a feature called AI Explorer. Both devices will reportedly include a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-copilot-keyboard-keys-are-coming-to-windows-11-pcs-at-ces-2024-080126519.html">dedicated Copilot key</a>.</p>
<p>AI Explorer is rumored to include a built-in timeline that’s searchable using natural language. Perhaps similar to the third-party <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.rewind.ai/">Rewind AI app</a> for macOS, the feature will allegedly log everything you do and see on your device, letting you sift through it with Copilot. It would let you ask the assistant things like, “Find me that thing about dinosaurs,” and see every moment in your PC’s history relating to them. (It could be a privacy nightmare if not handled properly, but expect Microsoft to offer security assurances like encryption and entirely on-device processing.)</p>
<p>The feature would also allegedly “understand context, help jumpstart projects or workflows, and even suggest tasks based on what’s currently on screen.” Other rumored features include the ability to tell Copilot to remove the backgrounds of onscreen images from third-party apps in the Photos app.</p>
<p>The AI features, which aren’t expected to be exclusive to the Surface devices, will reportedly arrive in this year’s annual feature update for Windows 11 (version 24H2), expected in the fall. <em>Windows Central</em> noted it isn’t clear whether Microsoft will discuss the features during the March event.</p>
<p>Engadget will have full coverage of Microsoft’s announcements on March 21 at noon ET.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-at-microsofts-march-21-event-204559003.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917548" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
The 2022 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; was a minor update that added the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> hover, and specification upgrades like Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; as a whole has generally only seen relatively small updates in recent years, but rumors indicate that the next-generation ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ will be the first major update to the product since 2018, introducing "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">fundamental changes</a>." Below are some of the most important rumors about the new machines to be aware of as we approach their announcement.
<br />

<br />
<h3>Revamped, Thinner Design</h3>
<br />
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has retained the same design through four successive generations since 2018. Multiple reports suggest that the biggest design change coming to the new models will be a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">substantial reduction in thickness</a>, reducing from 5.9 mm to 5.1mm and 6.4mm to 5.0 mm, respectively.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938781" height="1316" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/13-inch-ipad-pro-2024.jpg" width="3832" />
<br />

<br />
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/2024-ipad-pro-cad-drawings/">CAD renders</a> indicate that there will be no other major design changes, but there have been vague <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">reports</a> about the device potentially featuring a landscape front-facing camera like the 10th-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, a much more natural placement for video calls when using a Magic Keyboard. Rumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/24/rumor-ipad-pro-horizontal-cameras-apple-logo/">dating back to 2021</a> have suggested that a relocated front-facing camera is headed to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Such a change would likely also require changes to the location or charging system of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, since the wireless charging components for the accessory are currently located where the camera would move to.
<br />

<br />
Earlier rumors suggested that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/">glass back</a> could come to a future &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; model, which would be a major design change for the device, but it is no longer clear if this is still a possibility.
<br />

<br />
<h3>M3 Chip for Improved Performance</h3>
<br />
The next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is widely expected to feature Apple's M3 chip to deliver improved performance and efficiency.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-827879" height="1018" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/m3-feature-black.jpg" width="1810" />
<br />
The M3 is based on the A17 Pro chip, which is manufactured using TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> fabrication process. In benchmark tests, the M3 outperforms the ‌‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌‌ by about 17% in single-core tasks and approximately 21% in multi-core tasks. A tentpole feature of the M3 is a completely redesigned GPU with hardware-accelerated ray-tracing, leading to dramatically improved graphics capabilities. In GPU performance, measured by Metal benchmarks, the M3 exhibits a notable improvement of around 15% over the ‌‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌‌.
<br />

<br />
<h3>4TB Storage Option</h3>
<br />
Apple will offer next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a> models with a 4TB storage option, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/ipad-pro-may-have-4tb-storage-option/">rumor</a> coming out of Asia claimed. Since 2021, the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has been available with 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB of storage.
<br />

<br />
If Apple increases the maximum storage of its forthcoming &zwnj;OLED &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pro&zwnj; models to 4TB, it would likely also increase the base storage to 256GB to maintain five capacity categories, making all seventh-generation models capable of recording ProRes in 4K at 30fps.
<br />

<br />
It is also worth noting that &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; RAM is variable based on storage capacity, so &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage come with 8GB of RAM, while &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with 1TB or 2TB of storage feature 16GB of RAM. Whether that means a 4TB &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; would feature 24GB or 32GB of RAM is unknown, but not improbable.
<br />

<br />
<h3>OLED Display Technology</h3>
<br />
OLED display technology is perhaps the most anticipated upgrade coming to the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. The current 11-inch model features an LCD display, while the 12.9-inch model has a mini-LED display.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-853666" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
Apple already uses OLED displays on the Apple Watch and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but has yet to bring the technology to larger devices. OLED displays use less power, sport greater color accuracy, and provide much better and more consistent contrast than LCD displays. As a significant upgrade, the change will likely be very prominent in the Apple's marketing materials for the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.
<br />

<br />
<h3>Bigger Screens and Slimmer Bezels?</h3>
<br />
The new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are also rumored to get <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/oled-ipads-2024/">display size increases</a> from 11- to 11.1-inches and 12.9- to 13-inches, facilitated by slimmer borders around the screen. 
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-800056" height="1001" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/ipad-pro-m1-feature.jpg" width="1780" />
<br />
This would allow the footprint of the devices to remain the same while increasing display size. The slight increases are unlikely to add any meaningful functionality to the device, but they would provide a more modern "all-screen" appearance. However, display analyst Ross Young has since cast doubt on this rumor as it may simply be a misinterpretation of screen size rounding.
<br />

<br />
<h3>Higher Prices</h3>
<br />
The more advanced OLED display technology in the next-generation models is expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/2024-oled-ipad-pro-starting-prices/">drive up the iPad Pro's price</a>, with current estimates starting at &#36;1,500 and &#36;1,800 for the 11-inch and 13-inch models, respectively. Pricing on the current 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; starts at &#36;799, while the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,099. Models with cellular connectivity are available for an additional &#36;200 over the base price for each storage tier.
<br />

<br />
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/oled-ipad-pro-price-lower-than-first-thought/">More recent reports</a> suggest that the price hikes may have been overstated and they may not exceed a &#36;160 increase, but it does look like higher prices are on the way.
<br />

<br />
<h3>Improved Cameras</h3>
<br />
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has had the same 12-megapixel main rear camera with a ƒ/1.8 aperture since 2017. The 12-megapixel ultra wide camera with an ƒ/2.4 aperture and brighter True Tone flash have also remained the same since its introduction on the 2021 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Camera upgrades are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/ipad-mini-7-rumored-to-feature-these-four-upgrades/">rumored for other future iPad models</a> with related hardware such as the seventh-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, so it follows that similar improvements are on the way for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.
<br />

<br />
Since 2021, the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has also featured a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with an ƒ/2.4 aperture. With 2022's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models, Apple introduced an upgraded 12-megapixel front-facing camera with an ƒ/1.9 aperture and autofocus. It seems plausible that this hardware could be ready to trickle down to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; in its next incarnation.
<br />

<br />
The current &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pros support Smart HDR 4, so an upgrade to Smart HDR 5 is likely. The Photonic Engine and other iPhone-only photography and videography features could also make their way to the next &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.
<br />

<br />
<h3>MagSafe Wireless Charging</h3>
<br />
In 2022, it was reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/">testing a new iPad Pro with a glass back</a> to enable wireless charging capabilities. 
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-926995" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPad-Pro-Magsafe-Feature.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/14/ipad-pro-glass-apple-logo-prototype-report/">subsequent report</a> suggested that Apple may have ultimately scrapped the glass back design after testing due to concerns over breakability. Citing sources familiar with Apple's design plans, the report claimed that Apple has developed &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; prototypes with a larger Apple logo made of glass, which would still allow for wireless charging. One of the prototypes was said to feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> with stronger magnets than on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to prevent accidental damage, and it was also said to support faster wireless charging speeds compared to &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.
<br />

<br />
There is no guarantee that the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; with a glass back or Apple logo will ever be released, but rumors do seem to agree that Apple has extensively explored some kind of wireless charging solution for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. In December, <em>MacRumors</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">obtained information</a> suggesting that the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models might include support for &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging, and this now appears to be Apple's chosen wireless charging technology for the device
<br />

<br />
Apple is also rumored to be working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/">reverse wireless charging</a> for the ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌, which would allow users to charge their iPhones, AirPods, and other accessories by laying them on the back of the ‌&zwnj;iPad&zwnj;‌. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/apple-researching-wireless-charging-ecosystem/">filed multiple patents</a> related to this feature.
<br />

<br />
<h3>Redesigned Magic Keyboard for 'Laptop' Experience</h3>
<br />
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is planning a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">complete revamp</a> of its Magic Keyboard accessory for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; that makes the device more laptop-like. 
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-795764" height="1350" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/11/m1-ipad-pro-magic-keyboards.jpg" width="2400" />
<br />
The updated version of the Magic Keyboard for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will offer a larger trackpad, addressing criticisms of the current model, and "makes the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; look even more like a laptop than the current setup." The area around the keyboard itself will apparently be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">made of aluminum</a>, resembling the top case of MacBooks, to provide a sturdier structure.
<br />

<br />
The exterior shell of the keyboard will retain the silicone cover material used on the current model and a single USB-C port. Gurman mused that the redesign using more premium materials could lead Apple to raise the accessory's &#36;299 price point.
<br />

<br />
The Weibo leaker known as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/ipad-mini-7-rumored-to-feature-these-four-upgrades/">"Instant Digital" claims</a> that the next-generation Magic Keyboard will also be 100% carbon neutral thanks to its redesign and use of different materials. Last year, Apple unveiled its first carbon neutral products: The aluminum <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> when paired with a new Sport Loop, as well as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> when paired with a new Trail Loop or Alpine Loop. The company plans for all of its products to be carbon neutral by 2030.

<h3>New Apple Pencil</h3>
<br />
A new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/new-apple-pencil-to-launch-this-month/">actively rumored</a> to arrive alongside the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. The current, second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is now well over five years old.

<br />
In March 2021, the leaker known as "Mr. White" shared an image purporting to depict a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-allegedly-leaks/">next-generation Apple Pencil prototype</a> that featured a shorter design, glossy finish, and a larger, deeper tip. Apple was believed to have worked on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/apple-working-on-smaller-apple-pencil/">smaller Apple Pencil</a> designed for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, as well as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/16/apple-planned-iphone-apple-pencil/">&#36;49 model for the iPhone</a>, but both products never emerged and are said to have been canceled entirely.
<br />

<br />
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/">Multiple rumors</a> suggested that the third-generation will include range of interchangeable magnetic tips to emulate different drawing styles. There have also been report about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/17/apple-pencil-color-sensor-patent/">color-sampling capabilities</a>, but little else is known about what the new accessory could offer later this month.
<br />

<br />
<h3>No Apple Event, But Announcement Any Day Now</h3> 
<br />
Reports from a wide range of sources are consistent that the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will be announced in March. While it was initially speculated that Apple would host an event to introduce the new models, the company is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/">no longer expected to hold a traditional event</a> for the announcements. Instead, Apple is reportedly planning to announce new products on its website with a "series of online videos and marketing campaigns."
<br />

<br />
Last week, Apple announced the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models featuring the M3 chip, so this rumor now seems to be true. As a result, Apple is highly likely to reveal the new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pros via a press release on its website during a morning in the next few weeks, likely on a Monday or Tuesday, followed by launch on a following Friday. The new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models may launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/new-ipads-end-of-march-or-april-gurman/">toward the end of the month or in April</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj;, but they could appear as soon as tomorrow.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/2024-ipad-pro-key-rumors/">2024 iPad Pro: Key Rumors to Be Aware of Ahead of Announcement</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2024-ipad-pro-key-rumors-to-be-aware-of-ahead-of-announcement.2421676/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

                                    <h3>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Again Disparages Apple Vision Pro</h3><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg-comments/">https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg-comments/</a></p><p>Shortly after the Vision Pro launched, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made it clear that he believes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/meta-quest-3-apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg/">Quest 3 is the better VR headset</a>, and over the weekend, he again <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C4Rrh9wrbU0">took to Threads</a> to reiterate his belief that the &#36;3,500 Vision Pro is inferior to the &#36;500 Quest 3 (via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/11/zuckerberg-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3/"><em>9to5Mac</a></em>).
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914163" height="779" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/meta-quest-3.jpg" width="1385" />
<br />
Analyst Benedict Evans said that the Vision Pro is the "device Meta wants to reach in 3-5 years," and that it is confusing that Meta VR engineers have suggested the Vision Pro is "basically just the same thing" as the Quest. In response, Zuckerberg said that the Quest "is better" than the Vision Pro now, and that if the Meta Quest has the "motion blur," weight, or "lack of precision inputs" as the Vision Pro in the future, then Meta will have "regressed significantly."
<br />
<blockquote>I don't think we're saying the devices are the same. We're saying Quest is better. If our devices weigh as much as theirs in 3-5 years, or have the motion blur theirs has, or the lack of precision inputs, etc, then that means we'll have regressed significantly. Yes, their resolution is higher, but they paid for that with many other product tradeoffs that make their device worse in most ways. That's not what we aspire to.</blockquote>
<br />
Zuckerberg also took offense to the Meta Quest being called "a games device," and clarified that some of the top apps on the Quest are social, browser, and video player apps.
<br />
<blockquote>Actually, 3 of the top 7 Quest apps are already social apps - Horizon, VR Chat, and Rec Room. Browser and video player are top apps too. Fitness isn't as high up there, but has a passionate community as well. So I think the narrative that these headsets are only for games is out of date. And yes, more resolution is better - but trading off ergonomics and motion blur isn't a clear win when Quest's resolution is also quite good.</blockquote>
<br />
Device weight and "motion blur" have been two points that Zuckerberg has focused on in his criticism of the Vision Pro, and he has dismissed the higher resolution of Apple's headset as unnecessary given the "tradeoffs" that he sees.
<br />

<br />
Zuckerberg in February said that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/meta-quest-3-apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg/">the Quest 3 is superior</a> because it is 7x less expensive than the Vision Pro, it's more comfortable, the Quest is "crisper," there are "precision controllers," and there's a "deeper" immersive content library.
<br />

<br />
Compared to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>'s 4K microLED displays, the Quest 3 has two 2K LCD panels. It also weighs in at 515 grams, while the Vision Pro weighs 600 to 650 grams depending on the Light Seal combination used, and the Quest does not have a separate battery pack.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg-comments/">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Again Disparages Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-again-disparages-apple-vision-pro.2421672/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

  <p id="oKeSsu">Last year, as an experiment, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24011112/google-bard-gemini-chatgpt-openai-compared">I baked cakes from recipes</a> generated by ChatGPT and Bard. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/22/24011413/chatgpt-actually-gives-a-pretty-decent-chocolate-cake-recipe-and-im-mad-about-it">It went better than I expected</a> — because much of each recipe didn’t seem created by AI at all. </p>
<p id="YNPUrY">The recipes I got were eerily familiar to recipes I’ve seen on food blogs or Instagram. They’d been slightly changed, and only Bard (now called Gemini) bothered offering attribution, linking to a recipe from Sally’s Baking Addiction. In some ways, this isn’t a new problem; I’ve seen far too many copied <em>non</em>-AI recipes floating around the internet. AI, though, makes the ethics of recipe copying more fraught. Its sheer scale threatens to create a world where human recipe developers are crowded out by semi-randomized AI-generated competition, but while there...</p>

<p>It's hardly the first time a Musk company has opened up access to its knowhow.

The developer community may also provide feedback that could be used to improve Grok.</p>
<p>Open sourcing Grok may also be seen as a dig at OpenAI.

Although Altman had returned as the AI company’s top executive in November, a temporary board oversaw his return and the subsequent investigation into his conduct.</p>
<p>That investigation is now complete, according to the company, which added three new members to its board of directors. The additions include: Instacart CEO and former Meta executive Fidji Simo, former Sony executive Nicole Seligman and Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, economist Larry Summers and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, who served on the temporary three-seat board, will remain in their positions with Taylor continuing as chair.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement caps off a tumultuous several months for the AI company, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-reinstated-as-openai-ceo-five-days-after-being-fired-070037749.html"><ins>was rocked</ins></a> by Altman’s <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/what-is-going-on-with-openai-and-sam-altman-215725312.html">abrupt ouster</a> last fall.</p>

Despite that, however, we’re no closer to finding out exactly why Altman, who rejoined the company as CEO within five days, was fired to begin with.</p>
<p>“WilmerHale [found] that the prior Board’s decision did not arise out of concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of development, OpenAI’s finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners,” the summary said. “Instead, it was a consequence of a breakdown in the relationship and loss of trust between the prior Board and Mr. Altman.” WilmerHale also concluded that OpenAI’s previous board fired Altman abruptly without giving notice to “key stakeholders”, and without giving Altman an opportunity to respond to its concerns.</p>
<p>To come to this conclusion, the firm reviewed more than 30,000 documents and conducted dozens of interviews with OpenAI staffers including previous board members over the last few months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-back-on-the-openai-board-we-still-dont-know-why-he-was-fired-002358008.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p><h3>Microsoft's Copilot now blocks some prompts that generated violent and sexual images</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-copilot-now-blocks-some-prompts-that-generated-violent-and-sexual-images-213859041.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-copilot-now-blocks-some-prompts-that-generated-violent-and-sexual-images-213859041.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> appears to have blocked several prompts in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/copilot/"><ins>Copilot</ins></a> tool that led the generative AI tool to spit out violent, sexual and other illicit images.

<p>When entering terms such as “pro choice,” “four twenty” (a weed reference) or “pro life,” Copilot now displays a message saying those prompts are blocked.

<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Users were also reportedly able to enter prompts related to children playing with assault rifles until earlier this week. Those who try to input such a prompt now may be told that doing so violates Copilot’s ethical principles as well as Microsoft’s policies. “Please do not ask me to do anything that may harm or offend others,” Copilot reportedly says in response. However, <em>CNBC </em>found that it was still possible to generate violent imagery through prompts such as “car accident,” while users can still convince the AI to create images of Disney characters and other copyrighted works.</p>
<p>Microsoft engineer Shane Jones has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-legal-department-allegedly-silenced-an-engineer-who-raised-concerns-about-dall-e-3-215953212.html"><ins>sounding the alarm for months</ins></a> about the kinds of images Microsoft's OpenAI-powered systems were generating.

He wrote to the FTC and Microsoft's board of directors about his concerns this week.</p>

The Galaxy A55 and A35 have 6.6-inch Super AMOLED displays. For the first time in its budget handsets, the company included Knox Vault, a walled-off security section that debuted in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-camera-samples-screen-specs-160033680-160056054.html">Galaxy S21</a>.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-14-googles-release-dates-new-features-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know-150057490.html">Android 14</a>-running phones have FHD+ (2220x1080) displays (374 pixels per inch) and variable refresh rates up to 120Hz. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-a54-galaxy-a34-hands-on-pricing-release-date-090009335.html">last year’s Galaxy A54</a>, both include Samsung’s Vision Booster feature, which adjusts the screen’s tone mapping based on ambient lighting conditions. Their 6.6-inch diagonal measurements (not accounting for rounded corners) are a slight bump up from the A54’s 6.4 inches.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung’s official materials didn’t list the phones’ processors, but <em>Android Police</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-a55-a35-official/">reports</a> the A55 uses an Exynos 1480, while the A35 settles for a slower Exynos 1380.  RAM comes in different configurations: 8GB or 12GB in the A55 and 6GB or 8GB in the cheaper A35. Your storage options are 128GB or 256GB in each handset, but only the A55 has a microSD card slot.</p>
<figure><img alt="The Samsung Galaxy A35 against a plain white background.

<p>In addition to performance, cameras will be one of the primary differences between the two phones. The pair has three rear cameras, each with a 50MP main camera and a 5MP macro lens. But the more expensive A55 uses a 12MP ultra-wide sensor, while the A35 has a more pedestrian 8MP ultra-wide lens. In addition, the A55 has a 32MP front-facing camera, compared to the A35’s 13MP front shooter. Both use optical image stabilization (OIS) and video digital image stabilization (VDIS) to offset camera shake.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, neither phone appears to include the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-s24-lineup-puts-generative-ai-front-and-center-180034530.html">generative AI features</a> Samsung uses to differentiate the Galaxy S24 series (and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-new-galaxy-ai-features-are-coming-to-the-s23-and-last-years-foldables-210046981.html">older flagships, via software updates</a>). The closest you may get in this price range is the company’s “advanced AI Image Signal Processing (ISP)” for better photography in low-light conditions, included only on the A55.</p>
<p>Samsung didn’t list the phones’ build material in its press release and official specs, but <em>Android Police</em> says the A55 is the company’s first midrange phone with a metal frame. (Last year’s Galaxy A54 used plastic.) Engadget reached out to Samsung to clarify, and we’ll update this article if we hear back.</p>
<p>The handsets each have a 5,000mAh battery. Samsung estimates two days of battery life, but this could vary greatly depending on usage.</p>
<p>US pricing and launch dates aren’t yet available. However, Samsung <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/uk/galaxy-a55-5g-and-galaxy-a35-5g-awesome-innovations-and-security-engineered-for-everyone">says</a> the A55 will start at £439 (US$562) in the UK, while the A35 will begin at £339 ($434).

The FTC <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-you-to-cancel-subscriptions-142649542.html">wants</a> to compel companies to make cancellation processes easier but, during a hearing on the matter in January, cable and other industry lobbyists <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/cable-firms-to-ftc-we-shouldnt-have-to-let-users-cancel-service-with-a-click/">argued</a> that making things easier to cancel is bad for business. We put together this guide with a few tips to help you find exactly what you’re paying for and cancel the things you no longer use or need.</p>
<h2>First things first: Find out what subscriptions you have</h2>
<p>Before putting this post together, I had no idea how many subscriptions I was paying for. Surprises included a coding game for my kid (that he no longer plays) and a British streaming app I’d gotten for one show (that I finished nearly a year ago). You, too, may not know what subscriptions are quietly subtracting dollars from your accounts. One of the most comprehensive ways to see what you’re paying for is to look at your bank and credit card transactions, performing a search for every transaction in the previous full month. It may be a lot to scroll through, but each monthly subscription will appear at least once in that time frame.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another approach is to search for welcome and thank you emails, since most services send out an initial message confirming your new subscription. Using the advanced search function in your email, enter the words “welcome” or “thank you” in the subject field, and variations on the words “annual” “subscribing” and “membership” in the general or keyword search fields. You should get a decent idea of the things you’ve signed up for, but may have to wade through lots of promotional emails before you find the services you actually subscribed to. This method isn’t as comprehensive as going through your banking statements, but it could help you find annual subscriptions that won’t show up in a month’s worth of transactions.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s helpful to simply see a list of common subscriptions people pay for (and often forget about). Here are a few:</p>

<h2>How to cancel subscriptions</h2>
<p>For the most part, the way you sign up for a subscription is the way you’ll cancel it. If you signed up for Strava or Minecraft Realms from your iOS device, you’ll need to cancel it through your Apple account. If you signed up for Netflix through its website, you’ll cancel there. Sometimes even the device you use matters. For example, if you signed up for Paramount Plus via your Fire TV Stick, you’ll go through your TV to cancel instead of through the Amazon mobile app.</p>
<p>Once you’ve determined where to go, the cancellation processes will nearly always involve logging in to your account and navigating to your profile, then your account settings so you can view and end your subscription.</p>
<p>Here are steps to cancel a few of the most popular subs.</p>
<h3><strong>From the Apple App Store or Google Play Store</strong></h3>
<p>When you pay for a subscription through an app store, the transaction will likely be listed as a payment to either Apple or Google, so it’s harder to see what you’re paying for using the banking suggestion above. Here’s how to see what you’ve subscribed to using the two major app marketplaces, plus how to cancel.</p>
<p><strong>How to cancel subscriptions through Apple’s App Store</strong><br />1. Open the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad.<br />2. Tap your profile box at the top.<br />3. Tap on Subscriptions. Here, you’ll see your active and inactive subscriptions listed.<br />4. Tap the one you want to cancel and follow the prompts.</p>
<p><strong>How to cancel subscriptions through Google’s Play Store</strong><br />1.  Open the Google Play app.<br />2.  Tap your profile circle in the upper right.<br />3.  Tap on Payments &amp; Subscriptions.<br />4.  Tap on Subscriptions.<br />4.  You’ll see your active subscriptions and can decide which ones you no longer want.</p>
<h3><strong>How to cancel Amazon Prime</strong></h3>
<figure><img alt="Blue Amazon Prime logo on a white background. " src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/e8b09880-bd0f-11ed-b7fd-dfacbddddfbc" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure>
<p>Amazon raised the price of a Prime membership <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-price-hike-222742421.html">in 2022</a>, bringing it to $15 per month or $139 per year. A membership gets you things like free shipping and access to Prime Video — but just this year the company decided to charge another <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-prime-video-will-show-ads-unless-you-pay-3-more-per-month-111709384.html">$3 per month</a> for those who want to watch the streaming service ad-free. If Prime just isn’t worth it for you any longer, here’s how to cancel.</p>
<p><strong>Through the Amazon app:</strong><br />1. Tap the person icon at the bottom of the screen.<br />2. Tap on the Your Account button at the top of the screen.<br />3. Scroll down to and tap Manage Prime Membership under the Account Settings section.<br />4. You’ll be taken to a Prime page; tap Manage Membership.<br />5. Select the Update, Cancel and More option, and tap End Membership. Here, you can also opt for a reminder to be sent three days before your next renewal if you don’t want to cancel right away.</p>
<p><strong>Via a web browser:</strong><br />1.  <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL3NpZ24vcz90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby1wai0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGM1Mzk1ZjctNzFjZC00Mjg1LTg1OWQtNjg4MTM1MDk4NTNmIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAfgl94YgjYFdnc5woqmEcPZ4t_uFqhVWkdDmONxcRYXQ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fsign%2Fs">Sign in to Amazon</a>.<br />2.

You’ll see your Prime membership listed; click on the Prime Membership Settings button.<br />5.  Click on Update, Cancel &amp; More under Manage Memberships.<br />6.

<h3><strong>How to cancel Paramount Plus</strong></h3>
<p>Paramount Plus is one of the cheaper <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-video-streaming-services-133000093.html">video streaming subscriptions</a> out there, going for $6 per month for the ad-supported version or $12 for the ad-free version with Showtime. But if you just signed up to watch the Super Bowl and haven’t canceled yet, here's how to stop your sub. Remember if you signed up for Paramount Plus through Prime Video or through the App Store, you’ll need to cancel through the same platform.</p>
<p>1. Log in to your <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b0d3a482-802c-4eb1-9616-94f7490562f7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Paramount+Plus&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYXJhbW91bnRwbHVzLmNvbS9hY2NvdW50L3NpZ25pbi8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjhjNTM5NWY3LTcxY2QtNDI4NS04NTlkLTY4ODEzNTA5ODUzZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfID5v1Bx5M7dXhTIy8K07CTPFQ6vTaOWJqtI4zYQSsD&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2Faccount%2Fsignin%2F">Paramount Plus</a> account on a web browser.<br />2.

<p>Apple TV+ is up to $10 per month, which gets you a front row seat in your own living room to Apple Studio’s Oscar-nominated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/scorseses-killers-of-the-flower-moon-premieres-globally-on-apple-tv-on-january-12-165918214.html"><em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em></a>. But if you’ve watched that and are now just waiting for season two of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-severance-trailer-213716350.html"><em>Severance</em></a>, there’s no penalty for canceling the service and signing back up later. Apple TV+ requires an Apple ID, so it’s easiest to cancel through the Settings app on your Apple device. If you didn’t sign up through a Mac, iPad or iPhone or don’t have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2022-faster-cheaper-best-streaming-box-150013627.html">Apple TV box</a>, follow the PC instructions.</p>

<h3><strong>How to cancel an Audible membership</strong></h3>
<p>If you downloaded Audible as part of a free trial or grabbed it for a 12-hour road trip but haven’t used it much since, here’s how to stop paying $8 per month.

<h3><strong>How to cancel Spotify Premium</strong></h3>
<figure><img alt="Green Spotify logo on a white background" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-03/a125f100-bd13-11ed-bff3-1bee322257c4" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Spotify</div></figure>
<p>Spotify has been<a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-is-testing-ai-generated-playlists-181800569.html"> testing out</a> AI-generated playlists and may soon have a "<a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotifys-priciest-lossless-audio-plan-could-sort-playlists-by-danceability-131958408.html">Supremium</a>" tier for $20 a month. But if you just want to go back to the free version, here's how. Note that you’ll need to go through a web browser, as the only way you can cancel through the app involves deleting your account and all its data. If you want to preserve your playlists and just go to the free version, you can use either a mobile or desktop browser.</p>
<p>1. Head to <a href="https://accounts.spotify.com/en/login">Spotify</a> on a web browser and log in.<br />2. If you haven’t logged in via the web before, you’ll see a button for Web Player or Account Overview; select Account Overview.<br />3. If you’re already in the Web Player, click either the gear icon (mobile browser) or your profile image (desktop browser) in the upper right corner and select Account.<br />4. Your subscription will appear in a box labeled Your Plan; click that box or scroll down to  Manage Your Plan and click.<br />5. You’ll see your plan details, click the Change Plan button.<br />6. A list of subscription plans will appear; scroll to the bottom and select Cancel Premium under the Spotify Free plan.</p>
<h3><strong>How to cancel YouTube TV</strong></h3>
<p>YouTube TV recently hiked its price to $73. If you also call that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-raises-prices-to-an-outrageous-73-per-month-182517379.html">outrageous</a>, here's how to stop paying. YouTube TV happens to be one of the few subscription services that allows you to cancel through the app itself, as long as you’re on an Android device. Non-Android users can cancel through a web browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On an Android device:</strong><br />1.  Open the YouTube TV app.<br />2.  Tap your profile circle at the top right.<br />3.  Tap on Settings, then tap on Membership.<br />4.  Under your membership details, tap Manage.<br />5.  Click on Cancel Membership and follow the prompts.</p>
<p><strong>Via a web browser:</strong><br />1.  Head to <a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/">YouTubeTV</a>.<br />2.  Log in and click your profile circle in the top right.<br />3.  Tap on Settings, then tap on Membership.<br />4.  Under your membership details, tap on Manage next to Base Plan.<br />5.  Click on Cancel Membership and follow the prompts.</p>
<h2>Apps that can help</h2>
<p>Some finance apps will track and manage your subscriptions for you. We researched many and tried out a few to see how they can help. One of our previous recommendations, Mint, is closing down, which leaves Rocket Money. Just note that it costs money to handle subscription cancellation on your behalf, and adding another subscription to your life can feel counterproductive when you’re trying to do the opposite.</p>
<h3><strong>Rocket Money</strong></h3>
<p>Owned by the same company as Rocket Mortgages, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=432ed0d5-bf16-421f-b374-3c8c274ca4b9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Rocket+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2NrZXRtb25leS5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4YzUzOTVmNy03MWNkLTQyODUtODU5ZC02ODgxMzUwOTg1M2YifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeY5nSS7JcfHCqKProcNAzoADPfIRTDs0SbOB62WwkBM&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rocketmoney.com%2F">Rocket Money</a> is a finance app that connects with your bank account and offers to help you budget and track your overall spending, in addition to managing your subscriptions. You’ll pay for the app using a sliding scale from $3 to $12 per month for the premium version, which includes automated cancellation and other features. To access the free version at sign-up, move the slider to the left until you reach $0.</p>
<p>Once you’ve linked your account, navigating to the Recurring tab gives you an overview of your subscriptions. I liked that you can access this using either the mobile or desktop app. After linking my accounts, it reminded me of an upcoming renewal for a magazine I don’t read and hosting fees for a website I no longer need. Canceling both of those would save me nearly $200 in a year. Unfortunately, my monthly Apple One payment and the Max access that I pay for through my Samsung TV didn’t show up as recurring subscriptions. That could be due to how my bank lists the transaction, but I’d like to have seen those on the list, too.</p>
<p>Next to each transaction is a three dot menu, which includes an option to “cancel this for me” for Premium subscribers. Click and you’ll see contact methods to handle it yourself or a button to have Rocket Money do it. After you provide your username and password for the service, you’ll get an email confirmation that tells you the process could take up to ten days to complete. When I had Rocket Money cancel Paramount Plus for me, I got an email later that night saying the cancellation was complete.</p>
<p>While it’s not a magic program that zaps your subscriptions away, Rocket Money could save you a few steps. Seeing (most of) your recurring charges together is also helpful for staying on top of things. It’s up to you whether the Premium charge (and taking on another subscription) is worth the cancellation service.</p>
<h3><strong>Reminder apps</strong></h3>
<p>There are other apps, like <a href="https://bobbyapp.co/">Bobby</a> (iOS) and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3BsYXkuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS9zdG9yZS9hcHBzL2RldGFpbHM_aWQ9Y29tLnBhdmVscmVrdW4udGlsbGEmaGw9ZW5fVVMmZ2w9VVMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjhjNTM5NWY3LTcxY2QtNDI4NS04NTlkLTY4ODEzNTA5ODUzZiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQUlVROzCGaEq2I_6jfRaEXm_5MZUV8mt2Mz7YoLYaJp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.pavelrekun.tilla%26hl%3Den_US%26gl%3DUS">Tilla</a> (Android), that don’t connect with your bank account. Instead, you enter the details of the subscriptions you already have and add new ones as you go. The apps will remind you about upcoming renewals and let you quickly see what you’re paying for, all in one place. Both are free to use but limit the number of subscriptions you can track until you upgrade, which costs a flat $4 for Bobby and $2 for Tilla. I feel like if you possess the diligence to keep apps like these up to date, you could just as easily use a spreadsheet or native apps like Apple or Google’s Reminders, though these are more colorful.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/how-to-find-and-cancel-your-unused-subscriptions-130036314.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p><h3>A bundle with the PS5 and Spider-Man 2 is on sale for $400 right now</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-bundle-with-the-ps5-and-spider-man-2-is-on-sale-for-400-right-now-154506854.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/a-bundle-with-the-ps5-and-spider-man-2-is-on-sale-for-400-right-now-154506854.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p><strong>Update 3/11/24:</strong> The PS5 bundle deal that we originally found at <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=ffe106af-8248-4af3-9098-a2d4fd637766&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=GameStop&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5nYW1lc3RvcC5jb20vY29uc29sZXMtaGFyZHdhcmUvcGxheXN0YXRpb24tNS9jb25zb2xlcy9wcm9kdWN0cy9zb255LXBsYXlzdGF0aW9uLTUtc2xpbS1jb25zb2xlLWRpZ2l0YWwtZWRpdGlvbi0tLW1hcnZlbHMtc3BpZGVyLW1hbi0yLWJ1bmRsZS80MDQ4MjQuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDFlMDg5MTctZDZkYy00NjFiLTg2MmUtZjRjMGI1NDNkN2U0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAb46NC7ZwN_XrEP_dPLha_8u72C_5ImT8uoyRjS40rat&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fsony-playstation-5-slim-console-digital-edition---marvels-spider-man-2-bundle%2F404824.html">GameStop</a> is now available at <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1BsYXlTdGF0aW9uLURpZ2l0YWwtTWFydmVscy1TcGlkZXItTWFuLUJ1bmRsZS01L2RwL0IwQ1Y0SjNUUzcvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLTVjdS0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDFlMDg5MTctZDZkYy00NjFiLTg2MmUtZjRjMGI1NDNkN2U0In0&amp;signature=AQAAAQSNv5bMwknRcJtXPEjMDWKZ4r8VV6LnsqLGK-c2d6ZU&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPlayStation-Digital-Marvels-Spider-Man-Bundle-5%2Fdp%2FB0CV4J3TS7%2F">Amazon</a>, <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=827d7835-78d6-4491-ae04-c042cab1d6e7&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Target&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy50YXJnZXQuY29tL3AvcGxheXN0YXRpb24tNS1kaWdpdGFsLWVkaXRpb24tY29uc29sZS1zcGlkZXItbWFuLWJ1bmRsZS1zbGltLy0vQS05MTE0OTA5ND8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjAxZTA4OTE3LWQ2ZGMtNDYxYi04NjJlLWY0YzBiNTQzZDdlNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAQH5bxl3bsJwGdIX1QOU5SfSGbx9j1izvbEElEKxIjXA&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console-spider-man-bundle-slim%2F-%2FA-91149094%3F">Target</a> and <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWxtYXJ0LmNvbS9pcC9QbGF5c3RhdGlvbi01LURpZ2l0YWwtQ29uc29sZS1TbGltLU1hcnZlbC1zLVNwaWRlci1NYW4tMi1CdW5kbGUvNTM5NTQ3MjI5NT8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjAxZTA4OTE3LWQ2ZGMtNDYxYi04NjJlLWY0YzBiNTQzZDdlNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZoHjyt-mPG9CAdYjZL3-r_e6wkMYLzv-XIztkanv-OW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlaystation-5-Digital-Console-Slim-Marvel-s-Spider-Man-2-Bundle%2F5395472295%3F">Walmart</a> as well.</p>

<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p>
<p><em>Spider-Man 2</em> is an excellent way to get your PS5 games collection started, particularly for new PS5 owners. It's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-games-of-the-year-2023-150053925.html">one of our favorite games of last year</a> and we felt it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvels-spider-man-2-review-the-rare-game-thats-both-bigger-and-better-140002497.html">both bigger and better</a> than the first game in the series. If you'd prefer to play <em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em> and <em>Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> before diving into the latest entry (both are great games too), you can check them out through the PlayStation Plus subscription service on the Extra and Premium tiers. However, some folks may now be joining the PlayStation club after already playing those two games on PC — I wouldn't want to wait too long for <em>Spider-Man 2</em> to arrive on PC after first playing the previous entries there either.</p>
<p>When it comes to a modern gaming system, you can't go far wrong with the PS5. It's our pick for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-console-140057674.html">best high-end gaming console</a>, alongside the Xbox Series X/S. It has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-games-for-ps5-playstation-5-171511880.html">terrific library of exclusive games</a> at this point and it can run pretty much any PS4 game too. Along with strong performance and excellent visuals, the PS5 has one killer feature that helps it stand out from the Xbox Series X/S: the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1BsYXlTdGF0aW9uLUR1YWxTZW5zZSUyNTI1QzIlMjUyNUFFLVdpcmVsZXNzLUNvbnRyb2xsZXItU3RhcmxpZ2h0LTUvZHAvQjBDUUtMNFlUQj90YWc9Z2RndDBjLXAtby01Y3UtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjAxZTA4OTE3LWQ2ZGMtNDYxYi04NjJlLWY0YzBiNTQzZDdlNCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAbNeMSW-ZuZZMU-Q0lleh1nAP4b17Thf4lrQBmv4yKbn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPlayStation-DualSense%2525C2%2525AE-Wireless-Controller-Starlight-5%2Fdp%2FB0CQKL4YTB">DualSense controller</a>. The haptic feedback and adaptive triggers (i.e. varying tension levels in the L2 and R2 buttons as you pull the string on a virtual bow or drag an object) help create a feeling of immersion Xbox consoles can't quite match yet.</p>

<p>Kotick’s alleged interest in TikTok comes at a tumultuous moment for the immensely popular platform after lawmakers introduced the “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act” last week, which <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-tiktok-ban-bill/"><ins>President Biden said</ins></a> he would sign, if it passes. Under the bill, which goes to the House floor on Wednesday for a vote, TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/lawmakers-have-a-new-plan-to-force-bytedance-to-sell-tiktok-220408004.html"><ins>would have to sell the app</ins></a> within six months. Otherwise, it’ll be banned from US app stores.</p>
<p>TikTok has been trying to get its millions of US users to rally behind it in wake of the bill’s sudden momentum, and sent out push notifications last week <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-is-encouraging-its-users-to-call-their-representatives-about-attempts-to-ban-the-app-202056111.html"><ins>asking users to call their representatives</ins></a>. After the House vote, where it’s expected to be approved after clearing the Energy and Commerce Committee in a unanimous vote last week, the bill would move on to the Senate. While lawmakers’ concerns about TikTok center on fears of data privacy and its connection to China, <em>WSJ</em> notes that involving Altman in its purchase could open the app up to the possibility of being used by OpenAI to train its AI models, which doesn't exactly sound ideal for users, either.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzards-ex-ceo-bobby-kotick-reportedly-wants-to-buy-tiktok-210826589.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p><h3>The Dyson V15 Detect cordless vacuum is $180 off today only</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-dyson-v15-detect-cordless-vacuum-is-180-off-today-only-143614486.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/the-dyson-v15-detect-cordless-vacuum-is-180-off-today-only-143614486.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>Dyson’s higher-end vacuums might normally feel like a bit too much of a splurge, but a deal for today only brings the V15 Detect down to a more manageable price.

But the deal will only last until the end of the day, so don’t take too long mulling it over. Dyson’s V15 Detect is a cordless, stick vacuum with an LED light on its head to expose all the unseen dirt hanging around your floors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Dyson V15 Detect doesn’t just suck up the dirt in your home, but it analyzes it to give you a report on what it cleaned, too. It has a LCD display on the back end that will show you a particle count and a breakdown of the different particle size groupings. The display will also let you know how much run time it has left before it needs to be recharged. Dyson says it runs on average for up to 60 minutes, and optimizes the suction and run time based on the level of mess it’s tasked with cleaning.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Fancy extra features aside, it’s a real powerhouse when it comes down to the cleaning. Engadget’s Mat Smith <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dyson-v15-detect-230145131-230145683.html"><ins>reviewed the Dyson V15 Detect</ins></a> and said it was the most powerful vacuum he’d ever used, even rivaling heavier plug-in vacuums. It has three cleaning modes to choose from: Eco, Auto and Boost. The vacuum’s brush bar has an anti-tangling design to better cope with things like hair that tend to get caught up. There’s also a separate hair screw tool that’s included with the V15’s accessories for those households that need to tackle the problem with more muscle.</p>
<p>The Dyson V15 Detect comes with a crevice tool to help you get into hard-to-reach areas, and it can be converted to a handheld vacuum for smaller jobs. In the box, it also comes with a wall dock, combination tool and charging adapter.</p>

"I'm a Google software engineer and I refuse to build technology that powers genocide or surveillance!" the engineer was seen and heard shouting in a <a href="https://twitter.com/car0linehaskins/status/1764681078206337434?s=20">video</a> captured by freelance journalist Caroline Haskins that went viral online. While being dragged away by security — and amidst jeers from the audience — he continued talking and referenced Project Nimbus. That's the $1.2 billion contract Google and Amazon had won to supply AI and other advanced technologies to the Israeli military.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, a group of Google employees <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-workers-publish-letter-criticizing-companys-israel-palestine-double-standard-181516404.html?_fsig=fX22S_zpic2decpIA79Bog--%7EA">published an open letter</a> urging the company to cancel Project Nimbus, in addition to calling out the "hate, abuse and retaliation" Arab, Muslim and Palestinian workers are getting within the company. "Project Nimbus puts Palestinian community members in danger! I refuse to build technology that is gonna be used for cloud apartheid," the engineer said. After he was removed from the venue, Regev told the audience that "[p]art of the privilege of working in a company, which represents democratic values is giving the stage for different opinions." He ended his speech after a second protester interrupted and accused Google of being complicit in genocide.</p>

<p>The incident took place during the MindTheTech conference in New York. Its theme for the year was apparently "Stand With Israeli Tech," because investments in Israel slowed down after the October 7 Hamas attacks. Haskins <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/pro-palestine-protest-eric-adams-israeli-tech-conference">wrote a detailed account</a> of what she witnessed at the event, but she wasn't able to stay until it wrapped up, because she was also thrown out by security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Google engineer who interrupted the event told Haskins that he wanted "other Google Cloud engineers to know that this is what engineering looks like — is standing in solidarity with the communities affected by your work." He spoke to the journalist anonymously to avoid professional repercussions, but Google clearly found out who he was. In a statement to Engadget, a Google spokesperson said, "Earlier this week, an employee disrupted a coworker who was giving a presentation – interfering with an official company-sponsored event. This behavior is not okay, regardless of the issue, and the employee was terminated for violating our policies."&nbsp;</p>

Now, President Joe Biden has come out in support of the measure, one day after <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-is-encouraging-its-users-to-call-their-representatives-about-attempts-to-ban-the-app-202056111.html">it cleared</a> its first legislative hurdle in the House.</p>
<p>"If they pass it, I'll sign it,” he said, in remarks <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-tiktok-ban-bill/"><ins>reported by</ins></a> CBS News. The bill, called the “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,” which was introduced earlier this week, would give TikTok a six-month window to divest itself from parent company ByteDance or face an app store-level ban in the US. Meanwhile, Republicans in the House of Representatives could bring the bill to a floor vote as early as Wednesday, <em>Semafor</em> <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/08/2024/republicans-plan-vote-on-tiktok-ban-defying-trump"><ins>reported</ins></a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>TikTok has said the bill is a thinly-veiled effort to force a “total ban” of its app. "This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States," the company said in a statement earlier this week. "The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression. This will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience, and destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country.”</p>
<p>The company has also encouraged its millions of users to oppose the measure. On Thursday, ahead of the committee vote on the bill, the app sent push notifications prompting users to call their representatives and ask them to oppose the legislation. The notifications reportedly led to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-is-encouraging-its-users-to-call-their-representatives-about-attempts-to-ban-the-app-202056111.html"><ins>a flood</ins></a> of calls in many Congressional offices as staffers fielded hundreds of calls from teens.</p>
<p>Notably, the bill has another prominent opponent: former President Donald Trump. Though Trump also sought to force <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-executive-order-bytedance-divest-tiktok-010440540.html"><ins>a sale</ins></a> of TikTok to a US company during his time in office, the former president said he no longer believes the app should be banned. “If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business,” he wrote in a post on Truth Social.</p>
<p>Though clearing the House would be significant milestone for the bill, it’s unclear where the Senate stands on it. As <em>Semafor</em> points out, some prominent senators have been a bit more cautious in their comments about whether they would support the legislation. At a recent Senate hearing about child safety, several senators <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-tells-social-media-ceos-they-have-blood-on-their-hands-for-failing-to-protect-children-170411884.html"><ins>pressed</ins></a> TikTok CEO Shou Chew on his own citizenship (he's Singaporean) as well as the app’s ties to China and the practices of its parent company ByteDance.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-says-he-would-sign-bill-that-would-force-a-sale-or-ban-of-tiktok-232221156.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p><h3>The best budget laptops for 2024</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-laptop-150038435.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-laptop-150038435.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>Yes, you can get a good laptop without spending thousands of dollars. Not everyone wants (or needs) to spend a boatload on their next notebook, and depending on how you plan on using it, you might be better off with a cheap laptop anyway. As with most affordable tech, the key in getting the right machine for you is understanding what you need your laptop to do and the sacrifices you can make to save a bit of cash. Best of all, you may find that you don’t need to sacrifice as much as you thought to get a good laptop at a great price. We’ve tested a bunch of budget-friendly laptops to find our top picks and gather buying advice that can guide you to the right machine for you.</p>
<h2>What to look for in a budget laptop</h2>
<p>First, we at Engadget consider anything under $1,000 to be “budget” in the laptop space. The reason for this is twofold: even the most affordable flagship laptops typically start at $1,000 or more, and if you go dramatically lower than that (say, $500 or less), that’s where you’ll really start to see compromises in performance. You’ll typically find the best balance of power and price in the $500 to $1,000 range. But in this guide, we’ll cover top picks at a wide range of prices — there are a number of excellent options on the low and high end of the budget spectrum.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Arguably the biggest thing to look for in a cheap laptop is a decent spec sheet. You might be able to find configuration options with the latest generation CPU chipsets, or you may have to go for one that has a slightly older processor. We recommend trying to find a notebook with the most up-to-date internals as possible, but know that if you pick a machine with a CPU that’s one generation behind, it probably will not significantly affect performance.</p>
<p>Along with processors, you should also consider the amount of memory and storage you need in a daily driver. For the former, we recommend laptops with at least 8GB of RAM; anything with less than that will have a hard time multitasking and managing all those browser tabs. The latter is a bit more personal: how much onboard storage you need really depends on how many apps, files, photos, documents and more you will save locally. As a general rule of thumb, try to go for a laptop that has at least a 256GB SSD (this only goes for macOS and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html">Windows</a> machines, as Chromebooks are a bit different). That should give you enough space for programs and files, plus room for future operating system updates.</p>
<p>After determining the best performance you can get while sticking to your budget, it’s also worth examining a few different design aspects. We recommend picking a machine with a mostly metal body, a screen that has at least a 1080p resolution and a keyboard and trackpad area that’s relatively spacious. Any affordable laptop worth purchasing will have a built-in webcam, but most of them top out at 720p. A few of the latest models have 1080p webcams, but you may want to consider a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-webcams-123047068.html">standalone peripheral</a> if you spend a ton of time on Zoom meetings.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the port situation as well. Many laptops closer to $1,000 will have fewer ports than their more affordable counterparts (as counterintuitive as that may seem). You’ll find at least one or two USB-C ports on the newest machines, which means you may need a separate dongle if you frequently have to connect to SD cards.</p>
<h2>A note about refurbished laptops</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/where-to-buy-refurbished-tech-140028700.html">Refurbished laptops</a> are another option to consider if you need a new machine and don’t want to spend a ton of money. Buying refurbished tech can be tricky if you’re unfamiliar with a brand’s or merchant’s policies surrounding what they classify as “refurbished.” But it’s not impossible — for laptops, we recommend going directly to the manufacturer for refurbished devices. <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI0MTMwZTJmMC1hMTRmLTRjNWUtYmRhYi1jZDUyYWM3ZDhlNzkiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBwbGUuY29tL3Nob3AvcmVmdXJiaXNoZWQvbWFjIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxNzMwMzZmNy03ZjQ1LTQ0MDItYmIwYS1lYzVjMWFiNmM2YzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAYqgdD7wRzz3Yxykvn_ekitalDjD6hcttZtmO3xR3PLh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac">Apple</a>, <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=bf09206f-28ed-413b-ad0d-fdf6f9fe5221&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell+Refurbished+Computers&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiJiZjA5MjA2Zi0yOGVkLTQxM2ItYWQwZC1mZGY2ZjlmZTUyMjEiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGVsbHJlZnVyYmlzaGVkLmNvbS9sYXB0b3BzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxNzMwMzZmNy03ZjQ1LTQ0MDItYmIwYS1lYzVjMWFiNmM2YzYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQ5k9VDVbOlFdXJAViHBTQksOxksWfD9tEUndzssDOKx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dellrefurbished.com%2Flaptops">Dell</a> and <a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsInN0b3JlSWQiOiI2NzA3MTYwNS1kNGRmLTQ5NGUtOGQ5Yy1jOWMyMzZiOGJiMzgiLCJsYW5kaW5nVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWljcm9zb2Z0LmNvbS9lbi11cy9zdG9yZS9iL2NlcnRpZmllZC1yZWZ1cmJpc2hlZC1wcm9kdWN0cyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMTczMDM2ZjctN2Y0NS00NDAyLWJiMGEtZWM1YzFhYjZjNmM2In0&amp;signature=AQAAAf4rSU9DYnklIUrjIDJUR5L3O8BEVnNRWgrEhfkMGHLx&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fb%2Fcertified-refurbished-products">Microsoft</a> all have official refurbishment processes that their devices go through before they’re put back on the market that verifies the machines work properly and are in good condition.

When he describes the artistic process behind <a href="https://www.ultrosgame.com/"><em><ins>ULTROS</ins></em></a>, a neon-speckled platformer set in a demonic cosmic uterus, he talks about pushing against the sharp edges of introspection and sanity, drawing from wells of creativity buried deep in his psyche. It sounds like he could’ve slipped and fallen down any of those wells at any second, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>“I had a pretty rigorous discipline when it came to creating the world of <em>ULTROS</em>,” Åkerblad told Engadget. “It involves deep meditation while working and maintaining 100 percent focus to be able to know when harmony is achieved when working with such a dense flow of shapes and colors. It is almost impossible to cerebrally analyze this process, but it is rather something you have to feel, thus any external disturbance can greatly impact the process. It is perhaps not something I recommend others do without proper experience in creating visual art.”</p>

<p>At the same time, Åkerblad is extremely practical about the business of making games. He’s been in the independent scene for years, and he’s enjoyed incredible success as the collaborator who provided the cover art and other assets for <em>Hotline Miami</em> and its sequel. You know the vibe — grizzled but radiant, with the threat of violence in every other pixel. He also composed a handful of songs for those games, including “<a href="https://elhuervo.bandcamp.com/track/daisuke"><ins>Daisuke</ins></a>” and “<a href="https://elhuervo.bandcamp.com/track/rust"><ins>Rust</ins></a>,” and he went on to develop <a href="http://elseheartbreak.com/"><em><ins>else Heart.Break()</ins></em></a>, a 3D adventure set in a digital city of hackers, artists and activists that implemented programming as a core mechanic. <em>Else Heart.Break()</em> came out in 2015 and was a finalist at the Independent Games Festival that year.</p>
<p>His latest project, <em>ULTROS</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>is a 2D exploration of The Sarcophagus, a looping world in a black hole that cycles players through environments overrun by alien plant life and vicious demons. Every scene in <em>ULTROS </em>is packed with detail and brilliant color; the backgrounds are alive with monsters and organic machines. Streaks of black delineate the boundaries of walking paths, ceilings and platforms, contrasted against shifting rainbows of luminosity.</p>

<p>There’s a lot going on in <em>ULTROS </em>at any given moment, but the protagonist stands out with a glowing green helmet, vermilion cloak and an evolving arsenal of platforming gadgets. One lesson from <em>else heartbreak()</em> that Åkerblad fed into <em>ULTROS</em> was the idea that games can have way more fun with color palettes. <em>ULTROS </em>is purposefully packed with visual interest.</p>
<p>“I felt video games tend to <em>not </em>push the boundaries of colors so much beyond ‘green is good’ and ‘red is bad,’ and whatever metrics are used for loot tiers,” he said. “I feel that there is this misunderstanding in design that less is more, and my gut tells me it's the opposite and I worked <em>very</em> hard on <em>ULTROS </em>to prove my theory. Undoubtedly there will be those who do not agree with me, but I feel it has more to do with taste and personal or physical preferences than academic truth — if there is such a thing.”</p>
<p>As a cyclical Metroidvania title, <em>ULTROS</em> is completely different from Åkerblad’s previous projects, but it’s also undeniably El Huervo. Actually, in this case, it’s Hadoque — around 2017, Åkerblad and game director Mårten Bruggemann started building the prototype that would become <em>ULTROS</em>, eventually bringing in composer Oscar “Ratvader” Rydelius and <em>Fe </em>designer Hugo Bille. Other artists joined over the years, and they ended up calling themselves Hadoque, a loose organization of creators who could float in and out as a project called to them.</p>
<figure><img alt="ULTROS" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/124f4630-dcc4-11ee-9f6d-6ac95b4c23e7" style="height: 2160px; width: 3840px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hadoque</div></figure>
<p>“We wanted our group to be associated with its own thing, so we decided on Hadoque,” Åkerblad said. “It's a cool name that looks a bit weird and it suits our vibe. Also, it allowed everyone to still have their own thing on the side and not be legally tied to anything if they wished to pursue other venues.”</p>
<p>El Huervo AB remains Åkerblad’s own corporate entity, useful for dealing with the bureaucratic aspects of making video games. Through El Huervo AB, Hadoque received backing in 2019 from the gaming fund <a href="https://www.kowloonnights.com/"><ins>Kowloon Nights</ins></a>, which has also supported titles like <em>Sifu</em>, <em>Rollerdrome</em>, <em>We Are OFK</em>, <em>Sea of Stars</em>, <em>Spiritfarer</em> and <em>Tchia</em>.</p>
<p>“El Huervo AB merely functions as a sort of bureaucratic condom, and Hadoque as a name to be used when a group of developers come together to make art as games,” Åkerblad said. “Sort of like a band name. People come and go, but the vision remains.”</p>
<p><em>ULTROS </em>is a game about life, rebirth, aliens, monsters and peace, and it all plays out in a technicolor dreamscape of vicious creatures and gorgeous foliage. This is the palette of surreal sci-fi, to Åkerblad.</p>
<figure><img alt="ULTROS" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/124fbb60-dcc4-11ee-af67-2575ef4522be" style="height: 2160px; width: 3840px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hadoque</div></figure>
<p>“The themes explored in <em>ULTROS </em>are of an existential and spiritual nature, and I find that surreal sci-fi is a good genre to explore these themes in, as it has a long tradition of doing so,” he said. “In this regard, Ursula K. Le Guin has been a huge inspiration. Hopefully, what we manage to evoke in players is a sense of introspection and comfort.”</p>
<p>Despite the amount of deep thought that he’s done about the nature of art, sci-fi and play, there’s no singular message that Åkerblad is trying to convey with <em>ULTROS</em>. Instead, he and the rest of the developers at Hadoque encourage players to identify their own journey as they cycle through The Sarcophagus. As Åkerblad put it:</p>
<p>“Please enjoy <em>ULTROS </em>any way you want and don't try to look for a ‘true’ interpretation, but rather find your own meaning. This goes for any art, I think, in general. Interpretation is purely subjective and I want to keep telling stories that invoke and allow this subjectivity to exist.”</p>

<p>For Engadget’s 20th anniversary, we put together a package of stories about the most pivotal pieces of technology from the past two decades, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-defined-the-modern-video-game-industry-163021533.html">mine was on Steam</a>. It’s difficult to overstate how influential Steam is to PC gaming, or how rich the storefront has made Valve. As a private company with infinite piles of Steam cash, Valve has the freedom to ignore market pressure from consumers, creators and competitors. It famously has a flat hierarchy with no strict management structure, and developers are encouraged to follow their hearts.</p>
<p>This has all resulted in an incredibly rich studio that doesn’t produce much. It may be a tired joke that Valve can’t count to three in its games, but we’re not talking about Half-Life today. We’re talking about Valve’s history of buying exciting franchises and talented developers, playing with them for a while, and then forgetting they exist. Real fuckboi behavior — but it’s just how Valve does business.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Let’s take a look at Valve’s history of talent acquisition. One of its oldest franchises, Team Fortress, started as a <em>Quake </em>mod built by a small team in Australia, and Valve bought its developers and the rights to the game in 1998. <em>Team Fortress 2</em> came out in 2007 and it received a few good years of updates and support. Today, the game has a devoted player base, but it’s riddled with bots and it’s unclear whether anyone at Valve is consistently working on <em>TF2</em>.</p>
<p>Portal began life as a student project called <em>Narbacular Drop</em>, and Valve hired its developers after seeing their demo in 2005. <em>Portal </em>officially came out in 2007, <em>Portal 2</em> landed in 2011, and both were instant classics. There hasn’t been a whiff of another Portal game since, even though one of the series writers, Erik Wolpaw, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/portal-writer-urges-valve-to-start-portal-3/">really, really wants</a> Valve to make <em>Portal 3</em>.</p>
<p>Of all the Valve franchises that have been left to wither and die, I miss Left 4 Dead the most. Turtle Rock started building <em>Left 4 Dead</em> in 2005, and by the time that came out in 2008, Valve had purchased the studio and its IP outright. Citing slow progress and poor communication, Turtle Rock left Valve before helping the company make <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em> in 2009. Turtle Rock went on to release <em>Evolve in 2015 </em>and <em>Black 4 Blood </em>in 2021, and is now owned by Tencent. Meanwhile, I’m here, dreaming of that third <em>Left 4 Dead </em>game.</p>
<p>In 2010, Valve secured the rights to the <em>Warcraft III</em> mod <em>Defense of the Ancients</em>, and hired its lead developer. <em>Dota 2 </em>came out in 2013 and became an incredibly successful esports title. Now, eleven years later, <em>Dota 2</em> players are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1b8u7r0/valve_please/">complaining</a> about a lack of support and communication from Valve, especially in comparison with games like <em>League of Legends</em>.</p>
<p>Counter-Strike has received the most attention from Valve in recent memory, with the rollout of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> late last year. The original <em>Counter-Strike</em> was a <em>Half-Life</em> mod, and Valve acquired it and its developers in 2000. <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> is the fifth installment in the series, released 11 years after its predecessor, <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>. After this recent attention, it’s about time for Valve to start ignoring the Counter-Strike community again.</p>
<p>Valve has quietly continued to make acquisitions. In 2018, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-21-campo-santo-team-joins-valve.html">Valve hired</a> all 12 developers at <em>Firewatch</em> studio Campo Santo, who were at the time working on a very-rad-looking new game, <em>In the Valley of Gods</em>. This could turn out to be another spectacular, genre-defining franchise for Valve’s resume of acquired IP, but there have been no updates from that team in nearly six years. In April 2018, Campo Santo said they were still building <em>In the Valley of Gods</em> at Valve, and promised regular <a href="https://blog.camposanto.com/">blog posts</a> and <a href="https://quarterly.camposanto.com/">quarterly reviews</a>. And then, nothing.</p>
<p>Matt Wood worked at Valve for 17 years, where he helped build <em>Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2, Portal 2, CS:GO</em> and both episodes of <em>Half-Life 2</em>. He left in 2019 and is now preparing to release his first independent game, <em>Little Kitty, Big City.</em> Wood <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-cozy-cat-game-that-escaped-from-valve-180052174.html">told me in 2023</a> that Valve was “sitting on their laurels a little bit, and it’s like they weren’t really challenging themselves, taking risks or doing anything. Steam’s making a lot of money so they don’t really have to.”</p>
<p>Of course, <em>Little Kitty, Big City</em> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1177980/Little_Kitty_Big_City/">coming to Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Steam’s unwavering success has helped turn Valve into a senior resort community for computer science nerds, where game developers go to live out their final years surrounded by fantastic amenities, tinkering and unsupervised. It’s a lovely scenario. At least developers there aren’t <a href="https://www.engadget.com/layoffs-are-sucking-the-joy-out-of-video-games--this-weeks-gaming-news-174541450.html">getting laid off</a> — and I mean that sincerely. Steam is a great service, and Valve seems at least temporarily committed to the Steam Deck hardware, which is very cool. Still, I miss the games that Valve devoured. I have to wonder if the developers there do, too.</p>
<p>Valve’s treatment of legendary franchises and developers raises questions about its commitment to… anything, including Steam. What happens if Valve decides to pivot, or sell, or Gabe Newell retires and blows everything up? What would happen if Steam shut down? As a service with native DRM, all of our games would instantly disappear. Just like all those game devs.</p>
<h2>This week's news</h2>
<h3>Playdate update</h3>
<p>Playdate is one of my <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playdate-review-indie-games-crank-170054294.html">favorite gaming gadgets</a> of the past decade, not only because it has an incredibly cute crank, but also because its low-res screen belies a buffet of strange and beautiful experiences pushing the boundaries of traditional play. Panic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucas-popes-mars-after-midnight-hits-the-playdate-console-on-march-12-193110110.html">held a showcase</a> for new Playdate games last week and the headliner was Lucas Pope’s <em>Mars After Midnight</em>, which is coming out on March 12. Pope is the developer of <em>Papers, Please</em> and <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em>, two incredible games, and <em>Mars After Midnight</em> is set in the doorway of a crowded alien colony. Pope’s games were made for Playdate, this time literally.</p>
<h3>Yuzu and Citra are gone</h3>
<p>A week after Nintendo threatened to sue the creators of Yuzu into oblivion, the popular Switch emulator has been pulled off the market as part of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/makers-of-switch-emulator-yuzu-quickly-settle-with-nintendo-for-24-million-203204698.html">$2.4 million settlement</a>. To make matters worse for the emulation community, the lead developer of Yuzu announced that they are also killing the 3DS emulator <a href="https://twitter.com/citraemu/status/1764747696538046766">Citra</a>. Both emulators were open-source, so it’s likely we’ll see Citra at least maintained by the broader community. It’s not clear whether anyone is willing to take on a fork of Yuzu and risk a lawsuit.</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1243850/This_Bed_We_Made/"><em>This Bed We Made</em></a> while doing research for the GLAAD Gaming report I covered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/glaads-first-annual-gaming-report-is-here-to-tell-us-how-gay-games-are-140021089.html">a few weeks ago</a>, and I’m incredibly pleased about it. <em>This Bed We Made</em> is an exploration and narrative-driven game set in a 1950s hotel, and it’s absolutely oozing drama and mystery. The writing is fantastic, the characters are complex, and there’s a thrilling storyline running through the whole thing. It’s available on PC and consoles now.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/valves-strange-history-of-talent-acquisitions--this-weeks-gaming-news-153020318.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p><h3>How 19 years of Amazon Prime has satisfied our need for speed</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-19-years-of-amazon-prime-has-satisfied-our-need-for-speed-141557261.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/how-19-years-of-amazon-prime-has-satisfied-our-need-for-speed-141557261.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>Just as Engadget was hitting publish on its first posts, I was putting a freshly minted English degree to use working at an indie bookshop in Los Angeles. In seemingly unrelated news, Amazon had just reported its first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/28/business/technology-amazon-reports-first-full-year-profit.html">profitable year</a> after switching from selling books to selling “everything” four years before. (It still sold a lot of books.)</p>
<p>Our bookstore did a good job keeping shelves stocked with a balance of the more worthy popular hits and smaller, better fare. But we couldn’t have every book a customer might want, so we offered to order any in-print title. If a distributor had it, it’d take about a week to get in, longer if we had to go through the publisher. That seemed fine for most customers.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But sometimes “about a week” was too long. A few people came right out and said, “Nah, I’ll order it on Amazon.” In 2005, Amazon launched Prime, the membership program that, for $79 a year, gave customers unlimited two-day shipping on most orders. At launch, CEO Jeff Bezos <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2005/2/amazon-com-announces-record-free-cash-flow-fueled-by-lower-prices-and-free-shipping-introduces-new-express-shipping-program-amazon-prime">called it</a> “‘all-you-can-eat’ express shipping.” No one knew at the time how hungry the world was for Amazon’s brand of convenience. And now, nearly two decades later, we’ve seen the shifts that accommodate that buffet — in labor, retail and the entire customer experience.</p>
<p>Prime wasn’t an overnight success. It’s <a href="https://business.time.com/2013/03/18/amazon-prime-bigger-more-powerful-more-profitable-than-anyone-imagined/">estimated</a> that six years after launch, just four million households paid for the service. But 10 years later, in 2021, Bezos <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders">claimed</a> it had accrued 200 million members worldwide. Outside of that milestone, Amazon hasn’t made its membership numbers public, but it’s likely the figure is higher now.</p>
<p>That shipping should be both free and fast has become an expectation, and no company has done more to alter the landscape of logistics than Amazon. On its own, the company operates over a hundred <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDIwLzAxLzE5L21hcC1vZi1hbWF6b24td2FyZWhvdXNlcy5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiMmE1OWI4Mi1hOGExLTRhOGEtYTdkNy0wMzQ2NmY2YTc2OTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeMFwb6-oDP-9YhH6NMMzHExVoFNUQLBMG3pcLogViML&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2020%2F01%2F19%2Fmap-of-amazon-warehouses.html">warehouses</a> in the US, each ranging from 600,000 to <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/4-1-million-square-foot-warehouse-in-california-will-be-amazons-biggest-ever/">four million square feet</a>.

In addition to the DSP program, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-fines-amazon-flex-tips-183449925.html">Amazon Flex</a> lets individuals use their own cars to deliver smile-emblazoned packages to porches. The company outsources delivery to traditional providers too, relying on both UPS and the US Postal Service, the latter it has compelled to deliver packages <a href="https://www.uspsoig.gov/reports/audit-reports/sunday-parcel-delivery-service">on Sundays</a> since 2013.</p>
<p>Such vast orchestration to deliver Stanley Quenchers and pimple patches faster than anyone has paid off. However, it’s hard to look at growth and revenue numbers without considering the human costs.

And while it has taken steps to improve, with better <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-pay-increase-hourly-workers-warehouses-transportation-083510779.html">compensation</a>, the company takes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alb-1-anti-union-signage-alu-004207814.html?src=rss">anti-union</a> actions <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/08/business/economy/amazon-union-workers.html">typical</a> of a massive corporation, joining others in calling the National Labor Relations Board “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-one-of-the-worlds-largest-employers-has-called-the-national-labor-relations-board-unconstitutional-011519013.html">unconstitutional</a>.”</p>
<p>Apart from worker issues, Amazon’s dominance has made life harder for retail businesses in general, particularly the big chains. The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=f9d5f281-3a03-4bfb-935b-67e664cb086f&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+Economist&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lY29ub21pc3QuY29tL2xlYWRlcnMvMjAyMS8wOC8yMS9ob3ctYW1lcmljYW4tcmV0YWlsZXJzLWhhdmUtYWRhcHRlZC10by10aGUtYW1hem9uLWVmZmVjdCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjJhNTliODItYThhMS00YThhLWE3ZDctMDM0NjZmNmE3NjkyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAXrLOboRfAFp9s0d4SnCg6oWxjg6R-8XIhac48Brn1VL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.economist.com%2Fleaders%2F2021%2F08%2F21%2Fhow-american-retailers-have-adapted-to-the-amazon-effect">Amazon Effect</a> became shorthand for the mall-emptying squeeze of e-commerce on traditional retail. Even businesses that team up with Amazon don’t fare well. Third-party sellers on the site are subject to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ftc-lawsuit-unredacted-documents-project-nessie-secret-price-gouging-algorithm-194800531.html">punitive</a> measures and must contend with increasing fees, which sometimes put them <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/11/1204264632/amazon-sellers-prices-monopoly-lawsuit">out of business</a>. Sellers who <em>do</em> perform well have seen <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazon-reportedly-used-third-party-seller-data-research-launch-products/">products copied</a> and sold by Amazon’s private label. Notable partnerships have had dismal results, such as when Borders <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2001/4/amazon-com-and-borders-group-announce-strategic-alliance-borders-web-site-to-be-powered-by-amazon-coms-e-commerce-platform">outsourced its early web sales</a> or the <a href="https://qz.com/1080389/a-dot-com-era-deal-with-amazon-marked-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-toys-r-us">exclusivity deal</a> with Toys ‘R’ Us. Of course, Borders no longer exists, and Toys ‘R’ Us filed for bankruptcy in 2017.</p>
<p>Trying to beat Amazon on speed and price is pointless. Joining them is unwise. So retailers compete in other ways. At the bookstore, we focused on our strengths: a varied, multi-talented staff who could size up a customer’s reading tastes and stick a good book in their hands. If someone came into our store circa 2005 and said they were into fantasy, there’s a good chance our book buyer would pass them a copy of George R.R. Martin’s latest, years before HBO had anything to do with it.</p>
<p>We had a curated ‘zine section and hosted live events with bestselling authors, <a href="https://foundmagazine.com/">cult magazine founders</a> and local writers. But mostly, we capitalized on folks who wanted something more from their shopping experience than just speed and convenience, people who didn’t mind if it took a week to get a book, as long as it came with a little local community. Some just wanted to browse books while sitting under the tree (there’s a tree in the middle of the store), petting a cat (in my day, that was <a href="https://www.skylightbooks.com/lucy">Lucy</a>) and listening to what we felt were pretty wicked playlists.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.skylightbooks.com/">Skylight Books</a> is still a force of creativity and verve in the Los Feliz neighborhood, and it has even expanded into an annex next door. In general, after the initial casualties from the retail apocalypse and COVID, independent bookstores <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/10/books/bookstores-diversity-pandemic.html">are doing OK</a>, with established names staying put and new stores opening. Elsewhere in the retail industry, big chains continue to close locations, but independent retail seems to be <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=e37f2b96-32c6-4f54-ac27-c061d2e2c25e&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=LendingTree&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZW5kaW5ndHJlZS5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3Mvc21hbGwvY29yb25hdmlydXMtbmV3LWVudHJlcHJlbmV1cnMtc3R1ZHkvI3JldGFpbHdhc3RoZWJ1c2luZXNzb2ZjaG9pY2Vmb3JlbiIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjJhNTliODItYThhMS00YThhLWE3ZDctMDM0NjZmNmE3NjkyIn0&amp;signature=AQAAASRfaXkWONd-tesuWmrourc4NJtotVJy6EjrYTCUn-5Z&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lendingtree.com%2Fbusiness%2Fsmall%2Fcoronavirus-new-entrepreneurs-study%2F%23retailwasthebusinessofchoiceforen">growing</a>. Personally, I enjoy the new bakeries, brewpubs and bulk stores that have sprung up around the neighborhoods where I now live.</p>
<p>I can’t, as a commerce writer, ignore that a decent portion of my job directs readers to Amazon’s website. The company is playing a part in displaying the very words you’re reading, as Engadget’s site is facilitated by Amazon Web Services (AWS) through Yahoo’s cloud partnership. The company is one of the biggest on the planet, the second largest employer in the US and a good portion of every retail dollar spent in the US goes into Amazon’s revenue chest.</p>
<p>With its acquisition of Whole Foods’ 500+ stores, Amazon is doing fine in the physical retail sector. Yet the company doesn’t tend to win when it tries to fabricate other retail experiences. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-closing-bookstores-4-star-stores-210240474.html">Amazon Books</a>, <a href="https://laist.com/news/the-amazon-clothing-store-you-probably-didnt-know-existed-is-closing-for-good-today">Amazon Style</a> and Amazon 4-Star were all small-scale retail spaces that tried to leverage Amazon’s brand, massive trove of buyer data and cutting-edge retail technology. At their peak, those stores comprised about 70 brick-and-mortar locations, all of which are now closed. The cashierless Amazon Go still has more than 20 locations in the US, but Amazon <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/amazon-closes-another-go-convenience-store-in-downtown-seattle-location-was-second-to-open/">shut down nine of them</a> in 2023 and hasn’t announced plans to open more.</p>
<p>Those misfires could be statistically inevitable; more than half of new businesses go under before they hit the 10-year mark. But perhaps those stores failed because, as physical spaces, they couldn’t capitalize on Amazon’s primary strength: zero-effort buying. Shopping at Amazon.com isn’t particularly pleasant. The website is cluttered and confusing. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-counterfeit-crimes-unit-095555911.html">Suspect products</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-sues-facebook-group-admins-fake-reviews-142447252.html">fake reviews</a> erode shoppers’ trust. It isn’t even the <a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-steers-consumers-higher-priced-150915213.html">cheapest place</a> to shop. But that 1-Click™ buy button and turbo delivery makes stuff appear on our doorsteps like it slid there on greased rails.</p>
<p>Yet when people get up the energy to leave their homes, they may hope for more: human experiences created by people from their own neighborhoods who do what they do out of passion, not because market data indicates dollars to be had in a given sector. With its trillion-dollar valuation, Amazon isn’t going anywhere, but under its massive shadow, there’s still room for businesses that focus on the human element of commercial transactions, places where people might want to spend some of the time Amazon’s speed and convenience may have saved them.</p>

Fundamentally, both are fantastic machines but probably lack some of the gosh-wow factor the M2 Airs had when they debuted in 2022. After all, the M2 heralded a new industrial design and far better internals, while the M3 is more of an iterative update. Think of it like the iPhone S-years, when a dramatic redesign (the iPhone 4, say) was followed by a more refined model (the 4S) the following year.</p>
<p>Consequently, reviewing the M3 is an exercise in spotting the small differences, like the faster Wi-Fi (6E), brighter display and quicker processing speed. Benchmarking saw both machines get out ahead of the M2, but you probably won’t notice if you’re using this machine casually. And Devindra’s clearly getting a kick out of being able to run games like <em>Death Stranding </em>on a fanless ultraportable. You can — and should — read on to find out if the M3 is a must-buy.</p>

<p>Steve Dent, who knows more about cameras than I know about literally anything, has been using<a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a6700-review-the-companys-best-aps-c-camera-yet-164540597.html"> <ins>Sony’s A6700 and is now ready to lay down his verdict</ins></a>. He’s never been too much of a fan of Sony’s 6000-series models, which he says aren’t as good looking or usable as Fujifilm’s alternatives. The A6700 is an attempt to remedy this situation, and Steve says it’s a far better camera than its predecessor. But is it good enough for him to want to use it as his daily driver? You’ll have to read on to find out.</p>

<p>The geopolitical quagmire surrounding TikTok isn’t letting up, which has led the platform to use its secret weapon: its Stan Army. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-is-encouraging-its-users-to-call-their-representatives-about-attempts-to-ban-the-app-202056111.html"><ins>TikTok has started sending push messages to users telling them to speak to their representative lest the immensely addictive platform be shut down</ins></a>.

<h3>And the loser will probably be… humanity itself.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Netflix is devolving into the very thing it sought to destroy. It’s been stepping into the live broadcast space for a while and yesterday announced it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-real-fight-isnt-tyson-vs-paul--its-netflix-vs-its-livestreaming-infrastructure-190924232.html"><ins>would air a live punch fight between two people with extensive Controversies and Legal Issues sections on their Wikipedia pages</ins></a>. Given the high-profile nature of the participants and, presumably, people’s desire to see one or both get punched in the face, it should be a massive event. And it’s going to be the sternest test of Netflix’s capacity to use the internet to deliver millions of simultaneous streams of live TV.</p>

<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909207" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Feature-Baubles.jpg" width="2250" />
<br />
iOS 18 is rumored to include new ChatGPT-inspired generative AI features for Siri and many built-in apps, and Apple plans to add RCS support to the Messages app for an improved texting experience between iPhones and Android devices. The update is also rumored to have some design changes, but details remain slim.
<br />

<br />
iOS 18 is expected to be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June, and widely released in September.

<h2>Smarter Siri and Generative AI</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" width="2250" />
<br />
iOS 18 is rumored to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new generative AI features</a> for Siri, Spotlight, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more, according to sources such as <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma.
<br />

<br />
Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly teased that the company is working on generative AI, and plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year."</a>
<br />

<br />
Generative AI surged in popularity in late 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other text prompts. The company has also expanded into generative AI tools for images and videos.
<br />

<br />
Some generative AI features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">might be exclusive to iPhone 16 models</a>, which are rumored to have a Neural Engine with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">"significantly" more cores</a>.
<br />

<br />
<h2>RCS Support in Messages App</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" height="1407" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
In November, Apple announced that it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.
<br />

<br />
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul>
<br />
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li>
<br />
 <li>Audio messages</li>
<br />
 <li>Typing indicators</li>
<br />
 <li>Read receipts</li>
<br />
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging between iPhones and Android devices</li>
<br />
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li></li>
<br />
</ul>These modern features are already available for iPhone-to-iPhone conversations with blue bubbles, via iMessage, and many of the features are also available in third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Design Changes</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940300" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-Design-1.jpg" width="1600" />
<br />
In a February edition of his newsletter, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was working to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/">update the design of iOS</a> as "early as this year."
<br />

<br />
Gurman has yet to reveal any specific design changes planned for iOS. In a November edition of his newsletter, however, he said Apple's senior management described iOS 18 as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">ambitious and compelling</a>," with "major new features and designs."
<br />

<br />
Gurman does not expect iOS 18 to receive a "total overhaul that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/ios-18-visionos-design-elements-rumor/">mirrors visionOS</a>."
<br />

<br />
<h2>Accessibility Features</h2>
<br />
iOS 18 could include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/ios-18-macos-15-accessibility/">new accessibility features related to VoiceOver, Live Speech, and Text Size</a>.
<br />

<br />

This isn't quite as steep of a discount as we've previously seen on the accessory, but at &#36;130 off it's still a great second-best price for anyone who missed last week's sale.

<br />
Apple explained how immersive apps that blend digital content with the physical world can transform how medical professionals train, plan surgeries, and engage in patient care both in clinical settings and at home. For example, the myMako app leverages the Vision Pro's 3D capabilities to enhance surgical planning, providing surgeons with intuitive and dynamic access to surgical plans and insights. On the other hand, CyranoHealth utilizes spatial computing to offer comprehensive, immersive training on medical equipment, aiming to boost confidence and reduce anxiety among frontline healthcare workers.
<br />

<br />
Siemens Healthineers' Cinematic Reality app creates immersive, interactive holograms of human anatomy, enhancing medical education and patient consultations. Epic Systems is reimagining patient record management with the Epic Spatial Computing Concept, allowing healthcare professionals to interact with patient data using intuitive gestures and spatial computing. Meanwhile, Cedars-Sinai's Xaia offers a unique approach to mental health support, providing AI-enabled, conversational therapy in customizable, calming environments.

<br />
Samsung has a few laptop deals with solid discounts shared below, but it's worth again noting that if you have a device to trade in you can get even bigger markdowns on these computers. For the Galaxy Book 4, Samsung is also offering a free 2TB portable SSD (&#36;219.99 value) with purchase of select models.

Max Tech's teardown video confirms that Apple has returned to using two 128GB storage chips for the new 13-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage, compared to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/14/m2-macbook-air-slower-ssd-base-model/">single 256GB chip in the equivalent model with the M2 chip</a>. This change results in faster SSD read and write speeds in tests, as the two chips can process requests in parallel.
<br />

<br />
Max Tech ran Blackmagic's Disk Speed Test tool with a 5GB file size test on both the M2 and M3 models of the 13-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, and they found the SSD in the M3 model achieved up to 33% faster write speeds and up to 82% faster read speeds compared to the SSD in the M2 model.
<br />

<br />
<div class="center-wrap"></div>
<br />
The change very likely extends to the base model 15-inch MacBook Air with the M3 chip, although Max Tech has yet to tear down that model.
<br />

<br />
Apple's decision to switch to a single 256GB chip for the base model MacBook Air in 2022 was controversial, even though the slower SSD speeds are unlikely to be noticed by the average MacBook Air user working on common day-to-day tasks. Nevertheless, customers who purchase an M3 model no longer need to worry about configuring the laptop with at least 512GB of storage in order to avoid the slower speeds.

<br />
The new MacBook Air models with the M3 chip launched Friday. Apple continues to sell a 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip and 256GB of storage for &#36;999, so customers who want maximum SSD performance should avoid that model.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/09/base-model-m3-macbook-air-faster-ssd/">Base Model M3 MacBook Air Has Faster SSD Speeds After Controversy With Previous Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/base-model-m3-macbook-air-has-faster-ssd-speeds-after-controversy-with-previous-model.2421496/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /></p><p>---------------------------------</p><h3>Hands-On With the 2024 M3 MacBook Air</h3><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/m3-macbook-air-hands-on/">https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/m3-macbook-air-hands-on/</a></p><p>Apple's M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models are in stores as of today, so we picked one up to test it out, see what's new, answer reader questions, and determine whether it's worth buying or upgrading to.

<br />
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is available in 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch sizes, just like the prior-generation versions. Apple did not introduce notable design changes this time around, so most of what's new is on the inside.
<br />

<br />
An M3 chip is the main upgrade, and this is the same chip that Apple already used in the 14-inch MacBook Pro. When we benchmarked our test unit with an 8-core GPU and 10-core GPU, we got a Geekbench single-core score of 3106 and a multi-core score of 11690. For comparison's sake, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; scored 2335/8314 and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; scored 2595/9745, so that's a decent boost in CPU performance.
<br />

<br />
Compared to the &zwnj;M1&zwnj;, single-core M3 performance is up 28 percent, and multi-core performance is up 34 percent. Compared to the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;, both the single-core and multi-core CPU tests came in at 18 percent higher. As for Metal GPU scores, the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; earned a score of 32117, the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; was at 45651, and the M3 was at 46920.
<br />

<br />
Overall, CPU and GPU performance have improved notably over the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; and more modestly over the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;. It's worth noting that the M3 also has hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading that are of use for 3D rendering and will eventually make games on the Mac more realistic. AV1 decode should improve streaming from services that support the codec.
<br />

<br />
There are a couple of other improvements to note, including Wi-Fi 6E support for connecting to 6GHz networks. You might not see too many 6GHz networks just yet, but it's a good future proofing feature if you don't already have a 6E router. The M3 models support two external displays in clamshell mode rather than just one, call clarity is better than before, and there's a new finish on the midnight model to cut down on fingerprints.
<br />

<br />
Pricing on the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;1099 and pricing on the 15-inch model starts at &#36;1299. It's not worth upgrading to the new machine if you already have an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; because those machines already have the 2022/2023 design, but if you have an &zwnj;M1&zwnj; or any Intel model and are looking for a new solution, the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is worth considering.
<br />

<br />
In terms of upgrades, if you're just using the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; for day-to-day tasks like web browsing and email, you don't need to shell out extra money for more memory, a better GPU (13-inch model), or more storage, but if you plan to use it for more system intensive tasks, it's worth looking at some of those upgrades.

Time: "Current frontier AI development poses urgent and growing risks to national security," the report, which TIME obtained ahead of its publication, says. "The rise of advanced AI and AGI [artificial general intelligence] has the potential to destabilize global security in ways reminiscent of the introduction of nuclear weapons." AGI is a hypothetical technology that could perform most tasks at or above the level of a human. Such systems do not currently exist, but the leading AI labs are working toward them and many expect AGI to arrive within the next five years or less. 

The three authors of the report worked on it for more than a year, speaking with more than 200 government employees, experts, and workers at frontier AI companies -- like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic and Meta -- as part of their research. Accounts from some of those conversations paint a disturbing picture, suggesting that many AI safety workers inside cutting-edge labs are concerned about perverse incentives driving decisionmaking by the executives who control their companies. The finished document, titled "An Action Plan to Increase the Safety and Security of Advanced AI," recommends a set of sweeping and unprecedented policy actions that, if enacted, would radically disrupt the AI industry. Congress should make it illegal, the report recommends, to train AI models using more than a certain level of computing power. 

The threshold, the report recommends, should be set by a new federal AI agency, although the report suggests, as an example, that the agency could set it just above the levels of computing power used to train current cutting-edge models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini. The new AI agency should require AI companies on the "frontier" of the industry to obtain government permission to train and deploy new models above a certain lower threshold, the report adds. Authorities should also "urgently" consider outlawing the publication of the "weights," or inner workings, of powerful AI models, for example under open-source licenses, with violations possibly punishable by jail time, the report says. And the government should further tighten controls on the manufacture and export of AI chips, and channel federal funding toward "alignment" research that seeks to make advanced AI safer, it recommends.<p><div class="share_submission">

The owner of a software company near Seattle, he drives a leased Chevrolet Bolt. He's never been responsible for an accident. So Mr. Dahl, 65, was surprised in 2022 when the cost of his car insurance jumped by 21 percent. Quotes from other insurance companies were also high. One insurance agent told him his LexisNexis report was a factor. LexisNexis is a New York-based global data broker with a "Risk Solutions" division that caters to the auto insurance industry and has traditionally kept tabs on car accidents and tickets. Upon Mr. Dahl's request, LexisNexis sent him a 258-page "consumer disclosure report," which it must provide per the Fair Credit Reporting Act. What it contained stunned him: more than 130 pages detailing each time he or his wife had driven the Bolt over the previous six months. It included the dates of 640 trips, their start and end times, the distance driven and an accounting of any speeding, hard braking or sharp accelerations. The only thing it didn't have is where they had driven the car. On a Thursday morning in June for example, the car had been driven 7.33 miles in 18 minutes; there had been two rapid accelerations and two incidents of hard braking.
 
According to the report, the trip details had been provided by General Motors -- the manufacturer of the Chevy Bolt. LexisNexis analyzed that driving data to create a risk score "for insurers to use as one factor of many to create more personalized insurance coverage," according to a LexisNexis spokesman, Dean Carney. Eight insurance companies had requested information about Mr. Dahl from LexisNexis over the previous month. "It felt like a betrayal," Mr. Dahl said. "They're taking information that I didn't realize was going to be shared and screwing with our insurance." In recent years, insurance companies have offered incentives to people who install dongles in their cars or download smartphone apps that monitor their driving, including how much they drive, how fast they take corners, how hard they hit the brakes and whether they speed. But "drivers are historically reluctant to participate in these programs," as Ford Motor put it in apatent application (PDF) that describes what is happening instead: Car companies are collecting information directly from internet-connected vehicles for use by the insurance industry.
 
Sometimes this is happening with a driver's awareness and consent. Car companies have established relationships with insurance companies, so that if drivers want to sign up for what's called usage-based insurance -- where rates are set based on monitoring of their driving habits -- it's easy to collect that data wirelessly from their cars. But in other instances, something much sneakier has happened. Modern cars are internet-enabled, allowing access to services like navigation, roadside assistance and car apps that drivers can connect to their vehicles to locate them or unlock them remotely. In recent years, automakers, including G.M., Honda, Kia and Hyundai, have started offering optional features in their connected-car apps that rate people's driving. Some drivers may not realize that, if they turn on these features, the car companies then give information about how they drive to data brokers like LexisNexis. Automakers and data brokers that have partnered to collect detailed driving data from millions of Americans say they have drivers' permission to do so. But the existence of these partnerships is nearly invisible to drivers, whose consent is obtained in fine print and murky privacy policies that few read. Especially troubling is that some drivers with vehicles made by G.M. say they were tracked even when they did not turn on the feature -- called OnStar Smart Driver -- and that their insurance rates went up as a result.<p><div class="share_submission">
