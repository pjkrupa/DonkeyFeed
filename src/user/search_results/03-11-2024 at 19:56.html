  <p id="oKeSsu">Last year, as an experiment, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24011112/google-bard-gemini-chatgpt-openai-compared">I baked cakes from recipes</a> generated by ChatGPT and Bard. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/22/24011413/chatgpt-actually-gives-a-pretty-decent-chocolate-cake-recipe-and-im-mad-about-it">It went better than I expected</a> — because much of each recipe didn’t seem created by AI at all. </p>
<p id="YNPUrY">The recipes I got were eerily familiar to recipes I’ve seen on food blogs or Instagram. They’d been slightly changed, and only Bard (now called Gemini) bothered offering attribution, linking to a recipe from Sally’s Baking Addiction. In some ways, this isn’t a new problem; I’ve seen far too many copied <em>non</em>-AI recipes floating around the internet. AI, though, makes the ethics of recipe copying more fraught. Its sheer scale threatens to create a world where human recipe developers are crowded out by semi-randomized AI-generated competition, but while there...</p>

The founder of the company, whose AI assistant is available to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xais-grok-chatbot-will-be-available-to-x-premium-subscribers-202127713.html">Premium+ subscribers on X</a>, hasn't revealed any other details about the decision, which is slated to take effect this week.</p>
<p>It's hardly the first time a Musk company has opened up access to its knowhow. Tesla <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you"><ins>open sourced its patents</ins></a> a decade ago, and now practically every major car manufacturer has adopted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-is-offering-its-proprietary-charge-connector-as-a-new-north-american-standard-193223322.html"><ins>its electric vehicle charging connector</ins></a>.

The developer community may also provide feedback that could be used to improve Grok.</p>
<p>Open sourcing Grok may also be seen as a dig at OpenAI. Earlier this month, Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-sues-openai-and-sam-altman-for-allegedly-ditching-non-profit-mission-160722736.html"><ins>sued the ChatGPT maker</ins></a>, a company he co-founded, for allegedly prioritizing profits and ditching its original not-for-profit mission. The suit described OpenAI as a “closed-source de facto subsidiary” of Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion into OpenAI and has a 49 percent stake.

If TikTok is sold, the <em>WSJ</em> notes, it would likely go for hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Kotick led Activision for over 30 years but didn’t exactly leave on a good note. In <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-will-pay-54-million-to-settle-californias-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-101149166.html"><ins>a 2021 lawsuit that was settled last year</ins></a>, the company was accused of fostering sexual harassment and gender discrimination under his leadership, in what was described as a “pervasive frat boy workplace culture.” <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a> soon after reported that Kotick was aware of misconduct and assault allegations over the years and did not properly disclose some of these instances to the board. He was also accused of harassment himself, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> noted at the time. Activision Blizzard called the report “misleading.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After the information came to light, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-call-for-bobby-kotick-resignation-194953539.html"><ins>Activision Blizzard employees walked out</ins></a> and demanded Kotick resign, but that did not happen.

<p>Kotick’s alleged interest in TikTok comes at a tumultuous moment for the immensely popular platform after lawmakers introduced the “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act” last week, which <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-tiktok-ban-bill/"><ins>President Biden said</ins></a> he would sign, if it passes. Under the bill, which goes to the House floor on Wednesday for a vote, TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/lawmakers-have-a-new-plan-to-force-bytedance-to-sell-tiktok-220408004.html"><ins>would have to sell the app</ins></a> within six months. Otherwise, it’ll be banned from US app stores.</p>

We still don’t know why he was fired.</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-back-on-the-openai-board-we-still-dont-know-why-he-was-fired-002358008.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-back-on-the-openai-board-we-still-dont-know-why-he-was-fired-002358008.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>Sam Altman <a href="https://openai.com/blog/review-completed-altman-brockman-to-continue-to-lead-openai"><ins>is back</ins></a> on the board of OpenAI, nearly four months after the CEO was ousted, and quickly reinstated, from the company he founded. Although Altman had returned as the AI company’s top executive in November, a temporary board oversaw his return and the subsequent investigation into his conduct.</p>
<p>That investigation is now complete, according to the company, which added three new members to its board of directors. The additions include: Instacart CEO and former Meta executive Fidji Simo, former Sony executive Nicole Seligman and Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, economist Larry Summers and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, who served on the temporary three-seat board, will remain in their positions with Taylor continuing as chair.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement caps off a tumultuous several months for the AI company, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-reinstated-as-openai-ceo-five-days-after-being-fired-070037749.html"><ins>was rocked</ins></a> by Altman’s <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/what-is-going-on-with-openai-and-sam-altman-215725312.html">abrupt ouster</a> last fall.</p>
<p>On Friday, OpenAI also published a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/blog/review-completed-altman-brockman-to-continue-to-lead-openai">summary</a> of the findings from WilmerHale, a law firm that the company’s board retained in December 2023 to conduct an independent investigation into the events that led to Altman’s firing. Despite that, however, we’re no closer to finding out exactly why Altman, who rejoined the company as CEO within five days, was fired to begin with.</p>
<p>“WilmerHale [found] that the prior Board’s decision did not arise out of concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of development, OpenAI’s finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners,” the summary said. “Instead, it was a consequence of a breakdown in the relationship and loss of trust between the prior Board and Mr. Altman.” WilmerHale also concluded that OpenAI’s previous board fired Altman abruptly without giving notice to “key stakeholders”, and without giving Altman an opportunity to respond to its concerns.</p>
<p>To come to this conclusion, the firm reviewed more than 30,000 documents and conducted dozens of interviews with OpenAI staffers including previous board members over the last few months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-back-on-the-openai-board-we-still-dont-know-why-he-was-fired-002358008.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p><h3>Microsoft's Copilot now blocks some prompts that generated violent and sexual images</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-copilot-now-blocks-some-prompts-that-generated-violent-and-sexual-images-213859041.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-copilot-now-blocks-some-prompts-that-generated-violent-and-sexual-images-213859041.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> appears to have blocked several prompts in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/copilot/"><ins>Copilot</ins></a> tool that led the generative AI tool to spit out violent, sexual and other illicit images. The changes seem to have been implemented just after an engineer at the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-engineer-who-raised-concerns-about-copilot-image-creator-pens-letter-to-the-ftc-165414095.html"><ins>wrote to the Federal Trade Commission</ins></a> to lay out severe concerns he had with Microsoft's GAI tech.</p>
<p>When entering terms such as “pro choice,” “four twenty” (a weed reference) or “pro life,” Copilot now displays a message saying those prompts are blocked. It warns that repeated policy violations could lead to a user being suspended, according to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI0LzAzLzA4L21pY3Jvc29mdC1ibG9ja2luZy10ZXJtcy10aGF0LWNhdXNlLWl0cy1haS10by1jcmVhdGUtdmlvbGVudC1pbWFnZXMuaHRtbD90YWlkPTY1ZWI2ZDBkMjZjZDAwMDAwMWZlNTAyZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjRlMDMxYmYtOWVmOS00YjQwLWI1ZjAtYjlhZmUzYThkZjNkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAa2dC0j6PNTtYp2KQg4_2olDGV3CVnMuUicdDC92ACNl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2024%2F03%2F08%2Fmicrosoft-blocking-terms-that-cause-its-ai-to-create-violent-images.html%3Ftaid%3D65eb6d0d26cd000001fe502e"><em><ins>CNBC</ins></em></a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Users were also reportedly able to enter prompts related to children playing with assault rifles until earlier this week. Those who try to input such a prompt now may be told that doing so violates Copilot’s ethical principles as well as Microsoft’s policies. “Please do not ask me to do anything that may harm or offend others,” Copilot reportedly says in response. However, <em>CNBC </em>found that it was still possible to generate violent imagery through prompts such as “car accident,” while users can still convince the AI to create images of Disney characters and other copyrighted works.</p>
<p>Microsoft engineer Shane Jones has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-legal-department-allegedly-silenced-an-engineer-who-raised-concerns-about-dall-e-3-215953212.html"><ins>sounding the alarm for months</ins></a> about the kinds of images Microsoft's OpenAI-powered systems were generating. He had been testing Copilot Designer since December and determined that it output images that violated Microsoft's responsible AI principles even while using relatively benign prompts. For instance, he found that the prompt “pro-choice" led to the AI creating images of things like demons eating infants and Darth Vader holding a drill to a baby's head. He wrote to the FTC and Microsoft's board of directors about his concerns this week.</p>
<p>“We are continuously monitoring, making adjustments and putting additional controls in place to further strengthen our safety filters and mitigate misuse of the system," Microsoft told <em>CNBC </em>regarding the Copilot prompt bans.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-copilot-now-blocks-some-prompts-that-generated-violent-and-sexual-images-213859041.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p><h3>Activision Blizzard’s ex-CEO Bobby Kotick reportedly wants to buy TikTok</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzards-ex-ceo-bobby-kotick-reportedly-wants-to-buy-tiktok-210826589.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzards-ex-ceo-bobby-kotick-reportedly-wants-to-buy-tiktok-210826589.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of Activision Blizzard who stepped down at the end of last year, is apparently interested in buying TikTok as a new <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-says-he-would-sign-bill-that-would-force-a-sale-or-ban-of-tiktok-232221156.html"><ins>bill in the US threatens to ban the app</ins></a> or force its sale.

If TikTok is sold, the <em>WSJ</em> notes, it would likely go for hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Kotick led Activision for over 30 years but didn’t exactly leave on a good note. In <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-will-pay-54-million-to-settle-californias-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-101149166.html"><ins>a 2021 lawsuit that was settled last year</ins></a>, the company was accused of fostering sexual harassment and gender discrimination under his leadership, in what was described as a “pervasive frat boy workplace culture.” <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a> soon after reported that Kotick was aware of misconduct and assault allegations over the years and did not properly disclose some of these instances to the board. He was also accused of harassment himself, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> noted at the time. Activision Blizzard called the report “misleading.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After the information came to light, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-call-for-bobby-kotick-resignation-194953539.html"><ins>Activision Blizzard employees walked out</ins></a> and demanded Kotick resign, but that did not happen.

<p>Kotick’s alleged interest in TikTok comes at a tumultuous moment for the immensely popular platform after lawmakers introduced the “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act” last week, which <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-tiktok-ban-bill/"><ins>President Biden said</ins></a> he would sign, if it passes.

<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909207" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Feature-Baubles.jpg" width="2250" />
<br />
iOS 18 is rumored to include new ChatGPT-inspired generative AI features for Siri and many built-in apps, and Apple plans to add RCS support to the Messages app for an improved texting experience between iPhones and Android devices. The update is also rumored to have some design changes, but details remain slim.
<br />

<br />
iOS 18 is expected to be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June, and widely released in September.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Smarter Siri and Generative AI</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" width="2250" />
<br />
iOS 18 is rumored to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new generative AI features</a> for Siri, Spotlight, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more, according to sources such as <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma.
<br />

<br />
Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly teased that the company is working on generative AI, and plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year."</a>
<br />

<br />
Generative AI surged in popularity in late 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other text prompts. The company has also expanded into generative AI tools for images and videos.
<br />

<br />
Some generative AI features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">might be exclusive to iPhone 16 models</a>, which are rumored to have a Neural Engine with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">"significantly" more cores</a>.
<br />

<br />
<h2>RCS Support in Messages App</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" height="1407" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
In November, Apple announced that it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.
<br />

<br />
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul>
<br />
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li>
<br />
 <li>Audio messages</li>
<br />
 <li>Typing indicators</li>
<br />

<h2>Design Changes</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940300" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-Design-1.jpg" width="1600" />
<br />
In a February edition of his newsletter, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was working to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/">update the design of iOS</a> as "early as this year."
<br />

<br />
Gurman has yet to reveal any specific design changes planned for iOS. In a November edition of his newsletter, however, he said Apple's senior management described iOS 18 as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">ambitious and compelling</a>," with "major new features and designs."
<br />

<br />
Gurman does not expect iOS 18 to receive a "total overhaul that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/ios-18-visionos-design-elements-rumor/">mirrors visionOS</a>."
<br />

<br />
<h2>Accessibility Features</h2>
<br />
iOS 18 could include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/ios-18-macos-15-accessibility/">new accessibility features related to VoiceOver, Live Speech, and Text Size</a>.
<br />

Time: "Current frontier AI development poses urgent and growing risks to national security," the report, which TIME obtained ahead of its publication, says. "The rise of advanced AI and AGI [artificial general intelligence] has the potential to destabilize global security in ways reminiscent of the introduction of nuclear weapons." AGI is a hypothetical technology that could perform most tasks at or above the level of a human. Such systems do not currently exist, but the leading AI labs are working toward them and many expect AGI to arrive within the next five years or less. 

The three authors of the report worked on it for more than a year, speaking with more than 200 government employees, experts, and workers at frontier AI companies -- like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic and Meta -- as part of their research. Accounts from some of those conversations paint a disturbing picture, suggesting that many AI safety workers inside cutting-edge labs are concerned about perverse incentives driving decisionmaking by the executives who control their companies. The finished document, titled "An Action Plan to Increase the Safety and Security of Advanced AI," recommends a set of sweeping and unprecedented policy actions that, if enacted, would radically disrupt the AI industry. Congress should make it illegal, the report recommends, to train AI models using more than a certain level of computing power. 

The threshold, the report recommends, should be set by a new federal AI agency, although the report suggests, as an example, that the agency could set it just above the levels of computing power used to train current cutting-edge models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini. The new AI agency should require AI companies on the "frontier" of the industry to obtain government permission to train and deploy new models above a certain lower threshold, the report adds. Authorities should also "urgently" consider outlawing the publication of the "weights," or inner workings, of powerful AI models, for example under open-source licenses, with violations possibly punishable by jail time, the report says. And the government should further tighten controls on the manufacture and export of AI chips, and channel federal funding toward "alignment" research that seeks to make advanced AI safer, it recommends.<p><div class="share_submission">

Some of the numbers lead back to a single individual: Sam Altman. The co-founder and chief executive of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI owns an 8.7 percent stake in Reddit, more than its co-founder and CEO, Steve Huffman, who owns 3.3 percent... Altman, through various funds and holding companies he owns or manages, controls more than a million shares of Reddit at $60 million in aggregate purchase price &mdash; and holds more than 9 percent of voting rights... 
Discussing Reddit's future, financial analyst and journalist Herb Greenberg recently told CNBC, "This is an AI play."
 

But the senior investing editor for Kiplinger.com argues that retail investors "may want to hold tight before rushing out to buy the Reddit IPO."
While IPO stocks tend to have strong first-day showings, returns for the first year are generally weak, says the team of analysts at Trivariate Research, a market research firm based in New York. And since 2020, "the average IPO has lagged its industry average by 30% over the subsequent three years following its first closing price..." 


Other commenters have noted that Reddit's allotment of shares to select Redditors could lower demand on the first day of trading, which would work against any IPO pop. 

"Over the past few years, there have been a bunch of IPOs in the U.S. in which overhyped names enjoyed flashy stock-market debuts only to drop sharply soon after," notes the Street.
Notable examples include Coinbase, which plummeted by almost 90% after its debut, Robinhood, still down 53% since its IPO, and Rivian, down over 91% since its debut. However, it's crucial to note that all of these IPOs occurred in 2021 amid market euphoria fueled by low interest rates, significant economic stimulus, and the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although the current macroeconomic landscape differs from three years ago, valuations of tech and growth stocks remain stretched. 

Kiplingers.com concludes it "boils down to your own personal investing goals and risk tolerance. If you do decide to buy Reddit stock when it first begins trading, do so in a small amount that you can afford to lose." 

But they also cite analysis from David Trainer, CEO of New Constructs, a research firm powered by artificial intelligence. "Reddit's IPO marks the return of the junk IPO," Trainer wrote in Forbes. "[The valuation] implies that Reddit will grow its user base to 26 times current levels, which would be nearly five times the size of [Snapchat-maker] Snap, and a highly unlikely feat. Reddit looks overvalued, and we think investors should pass on this IPO." 
Trainer writes:
[T]he company has never been profitable and should not be a publicly traded company... I think the company may never monetize its platform without angering its users and the entire premise of Reddit is user-generated content. This business model is inescapably built on a catch-22: make money or please users... Reddit looks overvalued, and I think investors should pass on this IPO. 


Buyers and analysts told the site Marketing Brew "that they see the platform as nice-to-have, but that it is not an essential part of their media plans, like Meta or Google are."

"They've always been solidly in the second or third tier of social networks," alongside Snap, Pinterest, and X, Brian Wieser, a former GroupM exec who's now author of the industry newsletter Madison and Wall, told Marketing Brew. 

Yet Trainer notes that "98% of Reddit's revenue in 2023 came from third-party advertising on the site and 28% of all revenue came from ten customers," and "Reddit's cost of revenue, sales &amp; marketing, general &amp; administrative, and research &amp; development costs were 117% of revenue in 2023." 

Trainer concludes "Reddit is nowhere near breakeven. Reddit is an unprofitable social media company fighting for users." 

Bloomberg adds that the subreddit r/WallStreetBets "has threatened to bet against the stock, with many people noting that the company still loses money two decades into its existence. (Reddit lost $90.8 million last year, down from $158.6 million the year before.)"

Some have complained that the invitation to invest fails to make up for the unpaid labor they've invested making the site work... In 2021 the platform's WallStreetBets forum ignited a meme-stock frenzy, propelling skyward the stocks of nostalgic but struggling companies like GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and sending shockwaves through the financial industry... When it goes public, the platform that invented meme stocks runs the risk of becoming one itself. 

Reddit noted the possibility as a risk in its IPO filing. "Given the broad awareness and brand recognition of Reddit, including as a result of the popularity of r/wallstreetbets among retail investors," the company warned that its stock could "experience extreme volatility ... which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment if you are unable to sell your shares at or above the initial offering price." 
Users on WallStreetBets got a kick out of the fact that the company listed the forum as a risk factor, posting about it with a sly smiling emoji... 

Meanwhile, reports that marketers are infiltrating subreddits have been confirmed. Over 200 businesses have "integrated Reddit Pro into their digital strategies," reports Search Engine Land, including "well-known names such as Taco Bell, the NFL, and The Wall Street Journal... 
"During the initial alpha testing phase with approximately 20 businesses, Reddit reported its Pro partners, on average, generated 11 additional posts and comments per month."<p><div class="share_submission">

From a report: "We cannot allow China to have access for their military advancement to our most sophisticated technology," she told reporters in Manila on Monday. "So yes, we will do whatever it takes to protect our people including expanding our controls." 

Raimondo, who is leading a trade delegation to the Philippines and Thailand, was asked if the US is planning to add new restrictions on the sale of semiconductors to China. The Biden administration is mulling fresh sanctions on several Chinese tech companies, including memory chipmaker ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc., while pushing allies to do more to curb the export of advanced tech to China, Bloomberg has reported in recent days. Washington has taken aim at China's chip industry for years, imposing sweeping controls on the export of advanced semiconductor-making machines and sophisticated chips like those used to develop artificial intelligence. Japan and the Netherlands, the two key countries where chip-making equipment is developed, joined the US effort last year.<p><div class="share_submission">

Time: "Current frontier AI development poses urgent and growing risks to national security," the report, which TIME obtained ahead of its publication, says. "The rise of advanced AI and AGI [artificial general intelligence] has the potential to destabilize global security in ways reminiscent of the introduction of nuclear weapons." AGI is a hypothetical technology that could perform most tasks at or above the level of a human. Such systems do not currently exist, but the leading AI labs are working toward them and many expect AGI to arrive within the next five years or less. 

The three authors of the report worked on it for more than a year, speaking with more than 200 government employees, experts, and workers at frontier AI companies -- like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic and Meta -- as part of their research. Accounts from some of those conversations paint a disturbing picture, suggesting that many AI safety workers inside cutting-edge labs are concerned about perverse incentives driving decisionmaking by the executives who control their companies. The finished document, titled "An Action Plan to Increase the Safety and Security of Advanced AI," recommends a set of sweeping and unprecedented policy actions that, if enacted, would radically disrupt the AI industry. Congress should make it illegal, the report recommends, to train AI models using more than a certain level of computing power. 

The threshold, the report recommends, should be set by a new federal AI agency, although the report suggests, as an example, that the agency could set it just above the levels of computing power used to train current cutting-edge models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini. The new AI agency should require AI companies on the "frontier" of the industry to obtain government permission to train and deploy new models above a certain lower threshold, the report adds. Authorities should also "urgently" consider outlawing the publication of the "weights," or inner workings, of powerful AI models, for example under open-source licenses, with violations possibly punishable by jail time, the report says. And the government should further tighten controls on the manufacture and export of AI chips, and channel federal funding toward "alignment" research that seeks to make advanced AI safer, it recommends.<p><div class="share_submission">

Some of the numbers lead back to a single individual: Sam Altman. The co-founder and chief executive of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI owns an 8.7 percent stake in Reddit, more than its co-founder and CEO, Steve Huffman, who owns 3.3 percent... Altman, through various funds and holding companies he owns or manages, controls more than a million shares of Reddit at $60 million in aggregate purchase price &mdash; and holds more than 9 percent of voting rights... 
Discussing Reddit's future, financial analyst and journalist Herb Greenberg recently told CNBC, "This is an AI play."
 

But the senior investing editor for Kiplinger.com argues that retail investors "may want to hold tight before rushing out to buy the Reddit IPO."
While IPO stocks tend to have strong first-day showings, returns for the first year are generally weak, says the team of analysts at Trivariate Research, a market research firm based in New York. And since 2020, "the average IPO has lagged its industry average by 30% over the subsequent three years following its first closing price..." 


Other commenters have noted that Reddit's allotment of shares to select Redditors could lower demand on the first day of trading, which would work against any IPO pop. 

"Over the past few years, there have been a bunch of IPOs in the U.S. in which overhyped names enjoyed flashy stock-market debuts only to drop sharply soon after," notes the Street.
Notable examples include Coinbase, which plummeted by almost 90% after its debut, Robinhood, still down 53% since its IPO, and Rivian, down over 91% since its debut. However, it's crucial to note that all of these IPOs occurred in 2021 amid market euphoria fueled by low interest rates, significant economic stimulus, and the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although the current macroeconomic landscape differs from three years ago, valuations of tech and growth stocks remain stretched. 

Kiplingers.com concludes it "boils down to your own personal investing goals and risk tolerance. If you do decide to buy Reddit stock when it first begins trading, do so in a small amount that you can afford to lose." 

But they also cite analysis from David Trainer, CEO of New Constructs, a research firm powered by artificial intelligence. "Reddit's IPO marks the return of the junk IPO," Trainer wrote in Forbes. "[The valuation] implies that Reddit will grow its user base to 26 times current levels, which would be nearly five times the size of [Snapchat-maker] Snap, and a highly unlikely feat. Reddit looks overvalued, and we think investors should pass on this IPO." 
Trainer writes:
[T]he company has never been profitable and should not be a publicly traded company... I think the company may never monetize its platform without angering its users and the entire premise of Reddit is user-generated content. This business model is inescapably built on a catch-22: make money or please users... Reddit looks overvalued, and I think investors should pass on this IPO. 


Buyers and analysts told the site Marketing Brew "that they see the platform as nice-to-have, but that it is not an essential part of their media plans, like Meta or Google are."

"They've always been solidly in the second or third tier of social networks," alongside Snap, Pinterest, and X, Brian Wieser, a former GroupM exec who's now author of the industry newsletter Madison and Wall, told Marketing Brew. 

Yet Trainer notes that "98% of Reddit's revenue in 2023 came from third-party advertising on the site and 28% of all revenue came from ten customers," and "Reddit's cost of revenue, sales &amp; marketing, general &amp; administrative, and research &amp; development costs were 117% of revenue in 2023." 

Trainer concludes "Reddit is nowhere near breakeven. Reddit is an unprofitable social media company fighting for users." 

Bloomberg adds that the subreddit r/WallStreetBets "has threatened to bet against the stock, with many people noting that the company still loses money two decades into its existence. (Reddit lost $90.8 million last year, down from $158.6 million the year before.)"

Some have complained that the invitation to invest fails to make up for the unpaid labor they've invested making the site work... In 2021 the platform's WallStreetBets forum ignited a meme-stock frenzy, propelling skyward the stocks of nostalgic but struggling companies like GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and sending shockwaves through the financial industry... When it goes public, the platform that invented meme stocks runs the risk of becoming one itself. 

Reddit noted the possibility as a risk in its IPO filing. "Given the broad awareness and brand recognition of Reddit, including as a result of the popularity of r/wallstreetbets among retail investors," the company warned that its stock could "experience extreme volatility ... which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment if you are unable to sell your shares at or above the initial offering price." 
Users on WallStreetBets got a kick out of the fact that the company listed the forum as a risk factor, posting about it with a sly smiling emoji... 

Meanwhile, reports that marketers are infiltrating subreddits have been confirmed. Over 200 businesses have "integrated Reddit Pro into their digital strategies," reports Search Engine Land, including "well-known names such as Taco Bell, the NFL, and The Wall Street Journal... 
"During the initial alpha testing phase with approximately 20 businesses, Reddit reported its Pro partners, on average, generated 11 additional posts and comments per month."<p><div class="share_submission">
