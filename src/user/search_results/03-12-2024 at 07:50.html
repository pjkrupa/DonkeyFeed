<p id="YNPUrY">The recipes I got were eerily familiar to recipes I’ve seen on food blogs or Instagram. They’d been slightly changed, and only Bard (now called Gemini) bothered offering attribution, linking to a recipe from Sally’s Baking Addiction. In some ways, this isn’t a new problem; I’ve seen far too many copied <em>non</em>-AI recipes floating around the internet. AI, though, makes the ethics of recipe copying more fraught. Its sheer scale threatens to create a world where human recipe developers are crowded out by semi-randomized AI-generated competition, but while there...</p>

<p>It's hardly the first time a Musk company has opened up access to its knowhow. Tesla <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you"><ins>open sourced its patents</ins></a> a decade ago, and now practically every major car manufacturer has adopted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-is-offering-its-proprietary-charge-connector-as-a-new-north-american-standard-193223322.html"><ins>its electric vehicle charging connector</ins></a>.

The developer community may also provide feedback that could be used to improve Grok.</p>
<p>Open sourcing Grok may also be seen as a dig at OpenAI.

If TikTok is sold, the <em>WSJ</em> notes, it would likely go for hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Kotick led Activision for over 30 years but didn’t exactly leave on a good note. In <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-will-pay-54-million-to-settle-californias-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-101149166.html"><ins>a 2021 lawsuit that was settled last year</ins></a>, the company was accused of fostering sexual harassment and gender discrimination under his leadership, in what was described as a “pervasive frat boy workplace culture.” <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a> soon after reported that Kotick was aware of misconduct and assault allegations over the years and did not properly disclose some of these instances to the board. He was also accused of harassment himself, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> noted at the time. Activision Blizzard called the report “misleading.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After the information came to light, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-call-for-bobby-kotick-resignation-194953539.html"><ins>Activision Blizzard employees walked out</ins></a> and demanded Kotick resign, but that did not happen. Kotick ultimately stayed on as head of Activision Blizzard <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bobby-kotick-will-remain-activision-blizzard-ceo-until-the-end-of-2023-184419538.html"><ins>until the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition</ins></a> in 2023.</p>
<p>Kotick’s alleged interest in TikTok comes at a tumultuous moment for the immensely popular platform after lawmakers introduced the “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act” last week, which <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-tiktok-ban-bill/"><ins>President Biden said</ins></a> he would sign, if it passes. Under the bill, which goes to the House floor on Wednesday for a vote, TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/lawmakers-have-a-new-plan-to-force-bytedance-to-sell-tiktok-220408004.html"><ins>would have to sell the app</ins></a> within six months. Otherwise, it’ll be banned from US app stores.</p>
<p>TikTok has been trying to get its millions of US users to rally behind it in wake of the bill’s sudden momentum, and sent out push notifications last week <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-is-encouraging-its-users-to-call-their-representatives-about-attempts-to-ban-the-app-202056111.html"><ins>asking users to call their representatives</ins></a>. After the House vote, where it’s expected to be approved after clearing the Energy and Commerce Committee in a unanimous vote last week, the bill would move on to the Senate. While lawmakers’ concerns about TikTok center on fears of data privacy and its connection to China, <em>WSJ</em> notes that involving Altman in its purchase could open the app up to the possibility of being used by OpenAI to train its AI models, which doesn't exactly sound ideal for users, either.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzards-ex-ceo-bobby-kotick-reportedly-wants-to-buy-tiktok-210826589.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

Although Altman had returned as the AI company’s top executive in November, a temporary board oversaw his return and the subsequent investigation into his conduct.</p>
<p>That investigation is now complete, according to the company, which added three new members to its board of directors. The additions include: Instacart CEO and former Meta executive Fidji Simo, former Sony executive Nicole Seligman and Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, economist Larry Summers and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, who served on the temporary three-seat board, will remain in their positions with Taylor continuing as chair.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement caps off a tumultuous several months for the AI company, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-reinstated-as-openai-ceo-five-days-after-being-fired-070037749.html"><ins>was rocked</ins></a> by Altman’s <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/what-is-going-on-with-openai-and-sam-altman-215725312.html">abrupt ouster</a> last fall.</p>
<p>On Friday, OpenAI also published a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/blog/review-completed-altman-brockman-to-continue-to-lead-openai">summary</a> of the findings from WilmerHale, a law firm that the company’s board retained in December 2023 to conduct an independent investigation into the events that led to Altman’s firing. Despite that, however, we’re no closer to finding out exactly why Altman, who rejoined the company as CEO within five days, was fired to begin with.</p>
<p>“WilmerHale [found] that the prior Board’s decision did not arise out of concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of development, OpenAI’s finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners,” the summary said. “Instead, it was a consequence of a breakdown in the relationship and loss of trust between the prior Board and Mr. Altman.” WilmerHale also concluded that OpenAI’s previous board fired Altman abruptly without giving notice to “key stakeholders”, and without giving Altman an opportunity to respond to its concerns.</p>
<p>To come to this conclusion, the firm reviewed more than 30,000 documents and conducted dozens of interviews with OpenAI staffers including previous board members over the last few months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-back-on-the-openai-board-we-still-dont-know-why-he-was-fired-002358008.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

It warns that repeated policy violations could lead to a user being suspended, according to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI0LzAzLzA4L21pY3Jvc29mdC1ibG9ja2luZy10ZXJtcy10aGF0LWNhdXNlLWl0cy1haS10by1jcmVhdGUtdmlvbGVudC1pbWFnZXMuaHRtbD90YWlkPTY1ZWI2ZDBkMjZjZDAwMDAwMWZlNTAyZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjRlMDMxYmYtOWVmOS00YjQwLWI1ZjAtYjlhZmUzYThkZjNkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAa2dC0j6PNTtYp2KQg4_2olDGV3CVnMuUicdDC92ACNl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2024%2F03%2F08%2Fmicrosoft-blocking-terms-that-cause-its-ai-to-create-violent-images.html%3Ftaid%3D65eb6d0d26cd000001fe502e"><em><ins>CNBC</ins></em></a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Users were also reportedly able to enter prompts related to children playing with assault rifles until earlier this week. Those who try to input such a prompt now may be told that doing so violates Copilot’s ethical principles as well as Microsoft’s policies. “Please do not ask me to do anything that may harm or offend others,” Copilot reportedly says in response. However, <em>CNBC </em>found that it was still possible to generate violent imagery through prompts such as “car accident,” while users can still convince the AI to create images of Disney characters and other copyrighted works.</p>
<p>Microsoft engineer Shane Jones has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-legal-department-allegedly-silenced-an-engineer-who-raised-concerns-about-dall-e-3-215953212.html"><ins>sounding the alarm for months</ins></a> about the kinds of images Microsoft's OpenAI-powered systems were generating. He had been testing Copilot Designer since December and determined that it output images that violated Microsoft's responsible AI principles even while using relatively benign prompts. For instance, he found that the prompt “pro-choice" led to the AI creating images of things like demons eating infants and Darth Vader holding a drill to a baby's head. He wrote to the FTC and Microsoft's board of directors about his concerns this week.</p>
<p>“We are continuously monitoring, making adjustments and putting additional controls in place to further strengthen our safety filters and mitigate misuse of the system," Microsoft told <em>CNBC </em>regarding the Copilot prompt bans.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-copilot-now-blocks-some-prompts-that-generated-violent-and-sexual-images-213859041.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

If TikTok is sold, the <em>WSJ</em> notes, it would likely go for hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Kotick led Activision for over 30 years but didn’t exactly leave on a good note. In <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-will-pay-54-million-to-settle-californias-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-101149166.html"><ins>a 2021 lawsuit that was settled last year</ins></a>, the company was accused of fostering sexual harassment and gender discrimination under his leadership, in what was described as a “pervasive frat boy workplace culture.” <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a> soon after reported that Kotick was aware of misconduct and assault allegations over the years and did not properly disclose some of these instances to the board. He was also accused of harassment himself, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> noted at the time. Activision Blizzard called the report “misleading.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After the information came to light, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-call-for-bobby-kotick-resignation-194953539.html"><ins>Activision Blizzard employees walked out</ins></a> and demanded Kotick resign, but that did not happen. Kotick ultimately stayed on as head of Activision Blizzard <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/bobby-kotick-will-remain-activision-blizzard-ceo-until-the-end-of-2023-184419538.html"><ins>until the completion of Microsoft’s acquisition</ins></a> in 2023.</p>
<p>Kotick’s alleged interest in TikTok comes at a tumultuous moment for the immensely popular platform after lawmakers introduced the “Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act” last week, which <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-tiktok-ban-bill/"><ins>President Biden said</ins></a> he would sign, if it passes. Under the bill, which goes to the House floor on Wednesday for a vote, TikTok’s China-based parent company, ByteDance, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/lawmakers-have-a-new-plan-to-force-bytedance-to-sell-tiktok-220408004.html"><ins>would have to sell the app</ins></a> within six months. Otherwise, it’ll be banned from US app stores.</p>
<p>TikTok has been trying to get its millions of US users to rally behind it in wake of the bill’s sudden momentum, and sent out push notifications last week <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-is-encouraging-its-users-to-call-their-representatives-about-attempts-to-ban-the-app-202056111.html"><ins>asking users to call their representatives</ins></a>. After the House vote, where it’s expected to be approved after clearing the Energy and Commerce Committee in a unanimous vote last week, the bill would move on to the Senate. While lawmakers’ concerns about TikTok center on fears of data privacy and its connection to China, <em>WSJ</em> notes that involving Altman in its purchase could open the app up to the possibility of being used by OpenAI to train its AI models, which doesn't exactly sound ideal for users, either.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzards-ex-ceo-bobby-kotick-reportedly-wants-to-buy-tiktok-210826589.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

                                    <h3>Sam Altman is back on the OpenAI board. We still don’t know why he was fired.</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-back-on-the-openai-board-we-still-dont-know-why-he-was-fired-002358008.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-back-on-the-openai-board-we-still-dont-know-why-he-was-fired-002358008.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>Sam Altman <a href="https://openai.com/blog/review-completed-altman-brockman-to-continue-to-lead-openai"><ins>is back</ins></a> on the board of OpenAI, nearly four months after the CEO was ousted, and quickly reinstated, from the company he founded. Although Altman had returned as the AI company’s top executive in November, a temporary board oversaw his return and the subsequent investigation into his conduct.</p>
<p>That investigation is now complete, according to the company, which added three new members to its board of directors. The additions include: Instacart CEO and former Meta executive Fidji Simo, former Sony executive Nicole Seligman and Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, economist Larry Summers and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, who served on the temporary three-seat board, will remain in their positions with Taylor continuing as chair.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement caps off a tumultuous several months for the AI company, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-reinstated-as-openai-ceo-five-days-after-being-fired-070037749.html"><ins>was rocked</ins></a> by Altman’s <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/what-is-going-on-with-openai-and-sam-altman-215725312.html">abrupt ouster</a> last fall.</p>
<p>On Friday, OpenAI also published a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/blog/review-completed-altman-brockman-to-continue-to-lead-openai">summary</a> of the findings from WilmerHale, a law firm that the company’s board retained in December 2023 to conduct an independent investigation into the events that led to Altman’s firing. Despite that, however, we’re no closer to finding out exactly why Altman, who rejoined the company as CEO within five days, was fired to begin with.</p>
<p>“WilmerHale [found] that the prior Board’s decision did not arise out of concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of development, OpenAI’s finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners,” the summary said. “Instead, it was a consequence of a breakdown in the relationship and loss of trust between the prior Board and Mr. Altman.” WilmerHale also concluded that OpenAI’s previous board fired Altman abruptly without giving notice to “key stakeholders”, and without giving Altman an opportunity to respond to its concerns.</p>
<p>To come to this conclusion, the firm reviewed more than 30,000 documents and conducted dozens of interviews with OpenAI staffers including previous board members over the last few months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-back-on-the-openai-board-we-still-dont-know-why-he-was-fired-002358008.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

<br />
iOS 18 is rumored to include new ChatGPT-inspired generative AI features for Siri and many built-in apps, and Apple plans to add RCS support to the Messages app for an improved texting experience between iPhones and Android devices. The update is also rumored to have some design changes, but details remain slim.
<br />

<br />
iOS 18 is expected to be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June, and widely released in September.

Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly teased that the company is working on generative AI, and plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year."</a>
<br />

<br />
Generative AI surged in popularity in late 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other text prompts. The company has also expanded into generative AI tools for images and videos.
<br />

<br />
Some generative AI features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">might be exclusive to iPhone 16 models</a>, which are rumored to have a Neural Engine with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">"significantly" more cores</a>.

<h2>RCS Support in Messages App</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" height="1407" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
In November, Apple announced that it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.
<br />

<br />
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul>
<br />
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li>
<br />
 <li>Audio messages</li>
<br />
 <li>Typing indicators</li>
<br />
 <li>Read receipts</li>
<br />
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging between iPhones and Android devices</li>
<br />
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li></li>
<br />
</ul>These modern features are already available for iPhone-to-iPhone conversations with blue bubbles, via iMessage, and many of the features are also available in third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Design Changes</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940300" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-Design-1.jpg" width="1600" />
<br />
In a February edition of his newsletter, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was working to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/">update the design of iOS</a> as "early as this year."
<br />

<br />
Gurman has yet to reveal any specific design changes planned for iOS. In a November edition of his newsletter, however, he said Apple's senior management described iOS 18 as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">ambitious and compelling</a>," with "major new features and designs."
<br />

<br />
Gurman does not expect iOS 18 to receive a "total overhaul that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/ios-18-visionos-design-elements-rumor/">mirrors visionOS</a>."
<br />

<br />
<h2>Accessibility Features</h2>
<br />
iOS 18 could include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/ios-18-macos-15-accessibility/">new accessibility features related to VoiceOver, Live Speech, and Text Size</a>.
<br />

<br />

                                    <h3>Apple Reportedly 'Just Started Formal Development' of M4 MacBook Pro</h3><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-reportedly-developing-m4-macbook-pro/">https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-reportedly-developing-m4-macbook-pro/</a></p><p><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman today held a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2024-03-11/apple-car-canceled--live-q-a-with-bloomberg-s-mark-gurman">Q&amp;A session focused on the Apple Car</a>, in which he revealed that the vehicle's chip would have been equivalent to four M2 Ultra chips combined. He also said the vehicle had an underlying "safetyOS" system that was one part of the overall operating system, but he did not elaborate.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466" height="810" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg" width="1440" />
<br />
Gurman also briefly touched on a few other topics, including that Apple apparently "just started formal development" of a new MacBook Pro with an M4 chip. He did not provide any additional details about the chip, which has yet to be announced by Apple.
<br />

<br />
Apple announced the M1 chip for Macs in November 2020, followed by the M2 chip in June 2022 and the M3 chip towards the end of October 2023, so there has been around a year-and-a-half gap between each of the chips being introduced. If that pattern continues, the M4 chip would be released in the first half of 2025. However, a late 2024 release is also possible if the interval shrinks to one year.
<br />

<br />
Apple last updated the MacBook Pro lineup in October with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips. As part of that refresh, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro</a> and replaced it with a new base model 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip. Apple has also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-imac-with-m3-chip/">updated the iMac</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">and MacBook Air</a> with the M3 chip, leaving the Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro as the only current-generation Macs still equipped with the M2 family of chips.

Apple's chipmaking partner TSMC is expected to begin volume production of chips <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-designing-2nm-silicon-chips/">based on its 2nm process</a> in the second half of 2025, so the M4 chip will likely remain 3nm like the M3 chip. However, the M4 chip will likely be manufactured with an enhanced version of TSMC's 3nm process for improved performance and power efficiency.
<br />

<br />
Last month, the Taiwanese publication <em>Economic Daily News</em> reported that the M4 chip will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">feature an upgraded Neural Engine</a> with "significantly" more cores for artificial intelligence tasks, but no other specific details are known about the chip at this time.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macs/">M4 Macs</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-reportedly-developing-m4-macbook-pro/">Apple Reportedly &#039;Just Started Formal Development&#039; of M4 MacBook Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-just-started-formal-development-of-m4-macbook-pro.2421664/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

PCMag reports: Kotick floated the idea at a dinner at an Allen &amp; Co. conference earlier this week with a group of potential partners, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the Journal says. Kotick left Activision in late December after more than 30 years following the approval of the Microsoft merger and a tumultuous period that included a damaging discrimination lawsuit. And while he got a hefty golden parachute, it's probably not enough to buy TikTok, so he'll need partners with deep pockets. The report comes amid a vote in the House that would require TikTok to be sold or banned in the United States.<p><div class="share_submission">

Time: "Current frontier AI development poses urgent and growing risks to national security," the report, which TIME obtained ahead of its publication, says. "The rise of advanced AI and AGI [artificial general intelligence] has the potential to destabilize global security in ways reminiscent of the introduction of nuclear weapons." AGI is a hypothetical technology that could perform most tasks at or above the level of a human. Such systems do not currently exist, but the leading AI labs are working toward them and many expect AGI to arrive within the next five years or less. 

The three authors of the report worked on it for more than a year, speaking with more than 200 government employees, experts, and workers at frontier AI companies -- like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic and Meta -- as part of their research. Accounts from some of those conversations paint a disturbing picture, suggesting that many AI safety workers inside cutting-edge labs are concerned about perverse incentives driving decisionmaking by the executives who control their companies. The finished document, titled "An Action Plan to Increase the Safety and Security of Advanced AI," recommends a set of sweeping and unprecedented policy actions that, if enacted, would radically disrupt the AI industry. Congress should make it illegal, the report recommends, to train AI models using more than a certain level of computing power. 

The threshold, the report recommends, should be set by a new federal AI agency, although the report suggests, as an example, that the agency could set it just above the levels of computing power used to train current cutting-edge models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini. The new AI agency should require AI companies on the "frontier" of the industry to obtain government permission to train and deploy new models above a certain lower threshold, the report adds. Authorities should also "urgently" consider outlawing the publication of the "weights," or inner workings, of powerful AI models, for example under open-source licenses, with violations possibly punishable by jail time, the report says. And the government should further tighten controls on the manufacture and export of AI chips, and channel federal funding toward "alignment" research that seeks to make advanced AI safer, it recommends.<p><div class="share_submission">

PCMag reports: Kotick floated the idea at a dinner at an Allen &amp; Co. conference earlier this week with a group of potential partners, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the Journal says. Kotick left Activision in late December after more than 30 years following the approval of the Microsoft merger and a tumultuous period that included a damaging discrimination lawsuit. And while he got a hefty golden parachute, it's probably not enough to buy TikTok, so he'll need partners with deep pockets. The report comes amid a vote in the House that would require TikTok to be sold or banned in the United States.<p><div class="share_submission">

From a report: "We cannot allow China to have access for their military advancement to our most sophisticated technology," she told reporters in Manila on Monday. "So yes, we will do whatever it takes to protect our people including expanding our controls." 

Raimondo, who is leading a trade delegation to the Philippines and Thailand, was asked if the US is planning to add new restrictions on the sale of semiconductors to China. The Biden administration is mulling fresh sanctions on several Chinese tech companies, including memory chipmaker ChangXin Memory Technologies Inc., while pushing allies to do more to curb the export of advanced tech to China, Bloomberg has reported in recent days. Washington has taken aim at China's chip industry for years, imposing sweeping controls on the export of advanced semiconductor-making machines and sophisticated chips like those used to develop artificial intelligence. Japan and the Netherlands, the two key countries where chip-making equipment is developed, joined the US effort last year.<p><div class="share_submission">
