                                    <h3>Sam Altman is back on the OpenAI board. We still don’t know why he was fired.</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-back-on-the-openai-board-we-still-dont-know-why-he-was-fired-002358008.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-back-on-the-openai-board-we-still-dont-know-why-he-was-fired-002358008.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>Sam Altman <a href="https://openai.com/blog/review-completed-altman-brockman-to-continue-to-lead-openai"><ins>is back</ins></a> on the board of OpenAI, nearly four months after the CEO was ousted, and quickly reinstated, from the company he founded. Although Altman had returned as the AI company’s top executive in November, a temporary board oversaw his return and the subsequent investigation into his conduct.</p>
<p>That investigation is now complete, according to the company, which added three new members to its board of directors. The additions include: Instacart CEO and former Meta executive Fidji Simo, former Sony executive Nicole Seligman and Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor, economist Larry Summers and OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, who served on the temporary three-seat board, will remain in their positions with Taylor continuing as chair.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement caps off a tumultuous several months for the AI company, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-reinstated-as-openai-ceo-five-days-after-being-fired-070037749.html"><ins>was rocked</ins></a> by Altman’s <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/what-is-going-on-with-openai-and-sam-altman-215725312.html">abrupt ouster</a> last fall.</p>
<p>On Friday, OpenAI also published a <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://openai.com/blog/review-completed-altman-brockman-to-continue-to-lead-openai">summary</a> of the findings from WilmerHale, a law firm that the company’s board retained in December 2023 to conduct an independent investigation into the events that led to Altman’s firing. Despite that, however, we’re no closer to finding out exactly why Altman, who rejoined the company as CEO within five days, was fired to begin with.</p>
<p>“WilmerHale [found] that the prior Board’s decision did not arise out of concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of development, OpenAI’s finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners,” the summary said. “Instead, it was a consequence of a breakdown in the relationship and loss of trust between the prior Board and Mr. Altman.” WilmerHale also concluded that OpenAI’s previous board fired Altman abruptly without giving notice to “key stakeholders”, and without giving Altman an opportunity to respond to its concerns.</p>
<p>To come to this conclusion, the firm reviewed more than 30,000 documents and conducted dozens of interviews with OpenAI staffers including previous board members over the last few months.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/sam-altman-is-back-on-the-openai-board-we-still-dont-know-why-he-was-fired-002358008.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

                                    <h3>Microsoft's Copilot now blocks some prompts that generated violent and sexual images</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-copilot-now-blocks-some-prompts-that-generated-violent-and-sexual-images-213859041.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-copilot-now-blocks-some-prompts-that-generated-violent-and-sexual-images-213859041.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft/"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> appears to have blocked several prompts in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/copilot/"><ins>Copilot</ins></a> tool that led the generative AI tool to spit out violent, sexual and other illicit images. The changes seem to have been implemented just after an engineer at the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-engineer-who-raised-concerns-about-copilot-image-creator-pens-letter-to-the-ftc-165414095.html"><ins>wrote to the Federal Trade Commission</ins></a> to lay out severe concerns he had with Microsoft's GAI tech.</p>
<p>When entering terms such as “pro choice,” “four twenty” (a weed reference) or “pro life,” Copilot now displays a message saying those prompts are blocked. It warns that repeated policy violations could lead to a user being suspended, according to <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=34e37b9c-8975-48da-aa39-df8bcd5badc3&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=CNBC&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS8yMDI0LzAzLzA4L21pY3Jvc29mdC1ibG9ja2luZy10ZXJtcy10aGF0LWNhdXNlLWl0cy1haS10by1jcmVhdGUtdmlvbGVudC1pbWFnZXMuaHRtbD90YWlkPTY1ZWI2ZDBkMjZjZDAwMDAwMWZlNTAyZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMjRlMDMxYmYtOWVmOS00YjQwLWI1ZjAtYjlhZmUzYThkZjNkIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAa2dC0j6PNTtYp2KQg4_2olDGV3CVnMuUicdDC92ACNl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2024%2F03%2F08%2Fmicrosoft-blocking-terms-that-cause-its-ai-to-create-violent-images.html%3Ftaid%3D65eb6d0d26cd000001fe502e"><em><ins>CNBC</ins></em></a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Users were also reportedly able to enter prompts related to children playing with assault rifles until earlier this week. Those who try to input such a prompt now may be told that doing so violates Copilot’s ethical principles as well as Microsoft’s policies. “Please do not ask me to do anything that may harm or offend others,” Copilot reportedly says in response. However, <em>CNBC </em>found that it was still possible to generate violent imagery through prompts such as “car accident,” while users can still convince the AI to create images of Disney characters and other copyrighted works.</p>
<p>Microsoft engineer Shane Jones has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-legal-department-allegedly-silenced-an-engineer-who-raised-concerns-about-dall-e-3-215953212.html"><ins>sounding the alarm for months</ins></a> about the kinds of images Microsoft's OpenAI-powered systems were generating. He had been testing Copilot Designer since December and determined that it output images that violated Microsoft's responsible AI principles even while using relatively benign prompts. For instance, he found that the prompt “pro-choice" led to the AI creating images of things like demons eating infants and Darth Vader holding a drill to a baby's head. He wrote to the FTC and Microsoft's board of directors about his concerns this week.</p>
<p>“We are continuously monitoring, making adjustments and putting additional controls in place to further strengthen our safety filters and mitigate misuse of the system," Microsoft told <em>CNBC </em>regarding the Copilot prompt bans.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-copilot-now-blocks-some-prompts-that-generated-violent-and-sexual-images-213859041.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

                                    <h3>iOS 18 Rumor Recap: Smarter Siri, Design Changes, and More</h3><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ios-18-rumor-recap/">https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ios-18-rumor-recap/</a></p><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is still months away from being unveiled, but there are already several rumors and expectations for the software update, as outlined below.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909207" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Feature-Baubles.jpg" width="2250" />
<br />
iOS 18 is rumored to include new ChatGPT-inspired generative AI features for Siri and many built-in apps, and Apple plans to add RCS support to the Messages app for an improved texting experience between iPhones and Android devices. The update is also rumored to have some design changes, but details remain slim.
<br />

<br />
iOS 18 is expected to be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June, and widely released in September.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Smarter Siri and Generative AI</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" height="1266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" width="2250" />
<br />
iOS 18 is rumored to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new generative AI features</a> for Siri, Spotlight, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more, according to sources such as <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma.
<br />

<br />
Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly teased that the company is working on generative AI, and plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year."</a>
<br />

<br />
Generative AI surged in popularity in late 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other text prompts. The company has also expanded into generative AI tools for images and videos.
<br />

<br />
Some generative AI features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">might be exclusive to iPhone 16 models</a>, which are rumored to have a Neural Engine with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">"significantly" more cores</a>.
<br />

<br />
<h2>RCS Support in Messages App</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" height="1407" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
In November, Apple announced that it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.
<br />

<br />
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul>
<br />
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li>
<br />
 <li>Audio messages</li>
<br />
 <li>Typing indicators</li>
<br />
 <li>Read receipts</li>
<br />
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging between iPhones and Android devices</li>
<br />
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li></li>
<br />
</ul>These modern features are already available for iPhone-to-iPhone conversations with blue bubbles, via iMessage, and many of the features are also available in third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.
<br />

<br />
<h2>Design Changes</h2>
<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940300" height="900" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-Design-1.jpg" width="1600" />
<br />
In a February edition of his newsletter, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was working to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/">update the design of iOS</a> as "early as this year."
<br />

<br />
Gurman has yet to reveal any specific design changes planned for iOS. In a November edition of his newsletter, however, he said Apple's senior management described iOS 18 as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">ambitious and compelling</a>," with "major new features and designs."
<br />

<br />
Gurman does not expect iOS 18 to receive a "total overhaul that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/ios-18-visionos-design-elements-rumor/">mirrors visionOS</a>."
<br />

<br />
<h2>Accessibility Features</h2>
<br />
iOS 18 could include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/ios-18-macos-15-accessibility/">new accessibility features related to VoiceOver, Live Speech, and Text Size</a>.
<br />
