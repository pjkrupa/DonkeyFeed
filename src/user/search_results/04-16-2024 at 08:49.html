  <p id="p2vQGH">YouTube is bringing its ad blocker fight to mobile. In <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/269521462?hl=en">an update on Monday</a>, YouTube writes that users accessing videos through a third-party ad blocking app may encounter buffering issues or see an error message that reads, “The following content is not available on this app.”</p>
<p id="ikWzex">Last year, YouTube “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/31/23940583/youtube-ad-blocker-crackdown-broadening">launched a global effort</a>” to encourage users to allow ads while watching videos or upgrade to YouTube Premium. It also began <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/29/23778879/youtube-videos-disabling-ad-blockers-detection">disabling videos</a> for users with an ad blocking extension enabled. </p>
<p id="xpeTYJ">But now, YouTube says its policies don’t allow “third-party apps to turn off ads because that prevents the creator from being rewarded for viewership.” This appears to target mobile ad blockers like AdGuard, which lets you open YouTube within the ad...</p>

                                    <h3>Adobe previews AI object addition and removal for Premiere Pro</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-previews-ai-object-addition-and-removal-for-premiere-pro-130034494.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/adobe-previews-ai-object-addition-and-removal-for-premiere-pro-130034494.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>Last year <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-is-bringing-generative-ai-features-to-photoshop-after-effects-and-premiere-pro-130034491.html">Adobe launched Firefly</a>, its latest generative AI model building on its previous SenseiAI, and now the company is showing how it'll be used its video editing app, Premiere Pro. In an early sneak, it demonstrated a few key features arriving later this year, including Object Addition &amp; Removal, Generative Extend and Text to Video.</p>
<p>The new features will likely be popular, as video cleanup is one a common (and painful) task. The first feature, Generative Extend, addresses a problem editors face on nearly every edit: clips that are too short. &quot;Seamlessly add frames to make clips longer, so it's easier to perfectly time edits and add smooth transitions,&quot; Adobe states. It does that by using the AI to create extra media, helping cover an edit or transition.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Adobe previews AI object addition and removal for Premiere Pro" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/0d511580-fb2a-11ee-bda6-f1e03ab00e74" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adobe</div></figure>
<p>Another common issue is junk you don't want in a shot that can be tricky to remove, or adding things you <em>do</em> want. Premiere Pro's Object Addition &amp; Removal addresses that, again using Firefly's generative AI. &quot;Simply select and track objects, then replace them. Remove unwanted items, change an actor’s wardrobe or quickly add set dressings such as a painting or photorealistic flowers on a desk,&quot; Adobe writes.</p>
<p>Adobe shows a couple of examples, adding a pile of diamonds to a briefcase via a text prompt (generated by Firefly). It also removes an ugly utility box, changes a watch face and adds a tie to a character's costume.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="Adobe previews AI object addition and removal for Premiere Pro" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/978ee470-fb25-11ee-be4f-e3a9ec13250f" style="height: 1080px; width: 1920px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adobe</div></figure>
<p>The company also showed off a way it can import custom AI models. One, called Pika, is what powers Generative Extend, while another (Sora from OpenAI) can automatically generate B-Roll (video shots). The latter is bound to be controversial as it could potentially wipe out thousands of jobs, but is still &quot;currently in early research,&quot; Adobe said in the video. The company notes that it will add &quot;content credentials&quot; to such shots, so you can see what was generated by AI including the company behind the model.</p>
<p>A similar feature is also available in &quot;Text to Video,&quot; letting you generate entirely new footage directly within the app. &quot;Simply type text into a prompt or upload reference images. These clips can be used to ideate and create storyboards, or to create B-roll for augmenting live action footage,&quot; Adobe said. The company appears to be commercializing this feature pretty fast, considering that generative AI video first appeared <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-ai-startup-behind-stable-diffusion-is-now-testing-generative-video-105519658.html">just a few months ago</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those features will arrive later this year, but Adobe is also introducing updates to all users in May. Those include interactive fade handles to make transitions easier, Essential Sound badge with audio category tagging (&quot;AI automatically tags audio clips as dialogue, music, sound effects or ambience, and adds a new icon so editors get one-click, instant access to the right controls for the job&quot;), effect badges and redesigned waveforms in the timeline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Grok-1.5V is the company's first-generation multimodal AI model, which cannot only process text, but also &quot;documents, diagrams, charts, screenshots and photographs.&quot; In xAI's <a href="https://x.ai/blog/grok-1.5v">announcement</a>, it gave a few samples of how its capabilities can be used in the real world. You can, for instance, show it a photo of a flow chart and ask Grok to translate it into Python code, get it to write a story based on a drawing and even have it explain a meme you can't understand. Hey, not everyone can keep up with everything the internet spits out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new version comes just a couple of weeks after the company unveiled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musks-updated-grok-ai-claims-to-be-better-at-coding-and-math-120056776.html">Grok-1.5</a>. That model was designed to be better at coding and math than its predecessor, as well as to be able to process longer contexts so that it can check data from more sources to better understand certain inquiries. xAI said its early testers and existing users will soon be able to enjoy Grok-1.5V's capabilities, though it didn't give an exact timeline for its rollout.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to introducing Grok-1.5V, the company has also released a benchmark dataset it's calling RealWorldQA. You can use any of RealWorldQA's 700 images to evaluate AI models: Each item comes with questions and answers you can easily verify, but which may stump multimodal models like Grok. xAI claimed its technology received the highest score when the company tested it with RealWorldQA against competitors, such as OpenAI's GPT-4V and Google Gemini Pro 1.5.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-latest-version-of-xais-grok-can-process-images-120025782.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

At the time, OpenAI claimed that GPT-4 Turbo could receive six times as many pages of text — 300, compared to the previous 50.

The large language model can also create captions or descriptions of image prompts and handle text-to-speech requests.</p>

                                    <h3>Threads is testing real-time search results</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-is-testing-real-time-search-results-234857960.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/threads-is-testing-real-time-search-results-234857960.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>Meta’s Threads app is often described as the company’s competitor to X. But Threads users, especially those once active on Twitter, are often quick to point out that Meta’s app is not yet a great source for real-time information. The app’s “for you” algorithm often surfaces days-old posts alongside fresh ones, and its recently introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-finally-rolling-out-trending-topics-on-threads-184311138.html"><ins>trending topics</ins></a> feature only shows five topics at a time. But for those holding out hope that the app may eventually become more useful for real-time information, Meta’s latest test may be good news.</p>
<p>The app is testing a new search feature that will allow users to filter results by recency, according to <a href="https://www.threads.net/@danrodriguez312/post/C5xEdNrrZFB"><ins>a screenshot</ins></a> shared by Threads user Daniel Rodriguez. Threads’ top exec, Adam Mosseri, confirmed the change. “We’re starting to test this with a small number of people so it’s easier to find relevant search results in real time,” Mosseri <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C5yvw9LP4j8"><ins>wrote</ins></a>.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That may sound like a relatively minor tweak but the lack of a chronological search has long been frustrating for Threads users looking to find news or commentary about current events. And while sorting by “recent” posts isn’t the same as chronological search, it should help surface posts about breaking news or other timely topics.</p>
<p>Just how useful the feature is, though, will depend on if Meta makes the filter available to all topics on the platform. The screenshot showed a recency option for “NBA Threads,” a community Mosseri has gone out of his way <a href="https://www.engadget.com/threads-is-getting-into-live-sports-scores-starting-with-the-nba-185616086.html"><ins>to encourage</ins></a> in the app. But Mosseri has been considerably less enthusiastic about other timely topics, saying last year he didn’t want <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/CuZ3LjhNl0m"><ins>to encourage</ins></a> “hard news.” Elsewhere, Threads has angered some users by removing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-limits-political-content-recommendations-on-instagram-and-threads-123033533.html"><ins>political content</ins></a> from recommendations and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-blocking-potentially-sensitive-topics-from-threads-search-231028963.html"><ins>blocking</ins></a> search results for topics it deems “potentially sensitive,” like vaccines and COVID-19, even if the posts don’t violate its rules.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/threads-is-testing-real-time-search-results-234857960.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

                                    <h3>Rode's $90 MagSafe mount lets you attach pro lights and mics to your iPhone</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/rodes-90-magsafe-mount-lets-you-attach-pro-lights-and-mics-to-your-iphone-184033154.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/rodes-90-magsafe-mount-lets-you-attach-pro-lights-and-mics-to-your-iphone-184033154.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>Modern iPhone cameras are extremely capable video recorders, but typically require accessories like lights and microphones to ensure professional results. Audio gear manufacturer Rode just announced a pair of gadgets intended to simplify this process, so streamers won’t have to build a cumbersome rig in the computer room or haul one to an outdoor space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Rode Magnetic Mount <a href="https://rode.com/en-us/accessories/mounts-grips/magnetic-mount">is exactly what it sounds like</a>. It’s a MagSafe mount with a pair of connection points for accessories like the aforementioned lights and microphones. There are two adjustable cold shoe arms that allow people to use the phone in portrait or landscape mode. For the uninitiated, “cold shoe” refers to metal connection brackets that lack power, whereas “hot shoe” would refer to metal connection brackets that feature electronic contacts.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s not just for iPhones, as any smartphone snuggled into a MagSafe-compatible case should work. The Rode Magnetic Mount is made from high-grade aluminum, so it’s on the pricier side when compared to the endless barrage of similar products on Amazon. It costs <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL01hZ25ldGljLVNtYXJ0cGhvbmUtQWNjZXNzb3J5LU1hZ1NhZmUtQ29tcGF0aWJsZS9kcC9CMENZTFc0WUtLP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC12LWVrLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmMmJkMWJkMy1mM2M4LTQ5MmYtODFmZi1kZDJlYjZhNWQ1NDYifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAY2xU4nD2_p0HO8H-JURsUzUVNyFKYzg_hJ1oMhZm_Bq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMagnetic-Smartphone-Accessory-MagSafe-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB0CYLW4YKK">$90</a> and begins shipping on April 24.</p>

<p>Rode also <a href="https://rode.com/en-us/accessories/mounts-grips/phone-cage">announced the Phone Cage</a>, which promises to “turn your smartphone into a professional filmmaking rig.” This is basically a beefier version of the aforementioned accessory, with five cold shoe mounts for attaching anything a budding filmmaker could possibly need, all while keeping the phone safe and snug inside its cage.</p>
<p>To that end, the mounts integrate with an array of thread sizes for attaching accessories like tripods and handles. There are also cable management slots, as five accessories could mean five cables snaking about and threatening to ruin that perfect shot. Again, this is for MagSafe models, which start with the iPhone 12. It’ll also work with another brand of smartphone inside of a MagSafe-compatible case. The Phone Cage starts shipping on April 24 and costs $120.</p>
<p>Rode recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/audio-giant-rode-acquires-rival-mackie-to-expand-its-focus-on-creators-220023691.html">purchased rival audio gear company</a> Mackie and announced a renewed effort to design and release products for content creators. It looks like these mounts are part of that push. The company also just launched a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rode-reveals-a-dual-transmitter-version-of-the-wireless-me-lapel-mic-181534298.html">new dual-receiver wireless lapel microphone</a> for multi-mic setups.</p>

<p>This money will be spent to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-17-billion-chip-factory-texas-054150875.html"><ins>finish a “leading-edge” campus</ins></a> in Taylor, Texas that will focus on research and development of advanced logic technologies, manufacturing and, perhaps most importantly, packaging. When it comes to chips, packaging refers to providing power, inputs and outputs. It’s a highly specialized process that’s typically done overseas, which means that even chips built on US soil have to get shipped to another country and then mailed back. Samsung’s dedicated packaging facility should eliminate some of these headaches and strengthen the overall supply chain.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The money will also go toward an expansion of Samsung’s pre-existing facility in Austin. Taylor and Austin are only 40 minutes away from one another, leading the Biden administration to suggest that the combination of both facilities will turn “Samsung’s existing presence in Texas into a comprehensive ecosystem for the development and production of leading-edge chips in the United States.” The president also says it’ll lead to 21,500 jobs for Texans, with $40 million set aside for training.</p>
<p>The CHIPS and Science Act has given the federal government authority to award funding and offer loans to tech companies to encourage domestic spending. GlobalFoundries <a href="https://www.engadget.com/globalfoundries-secures-15-billion-in-chips-act-funding-for-us-expansion-172754429.html"><ins>received a grant of $1.5 billion back in February</ins></a> to help with a major expansion, in addition to snapping up a $1.6 billion loan. The company plans on spending this money in Malta, New York to build a new fabrication facility that manufactures chips for the automotive, aerospace, defense and AI industries.</p>
<p>Intel recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-will-get-85-billion-in-chips-act-funding-to-support-its-us-manufacturing-efforts-090046810.html"><ins>received the largest CHIPS grant to date</ins></a>, grabbing up to $8.5 billion to continue various US-based ventures. Intel plans on using that money to build some new plants that manufacture semiconductor chips for the AI industry. It’s building two new fabrication facilities in Arizona and two more in Ohio. Intel will also use the financial windfall to modernize a pair of pre-existing plants in New Mexico and one in Oregon. The company says it’ll be investing $100 billion in US-based chip manufacturing, leading to an influx of around 30,000 jobs.</p>
<p>President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law back in 2022 to encourage domestic semiconductor research and manufacturing in order to lessen America's reliance on Chinese suppliers. All told, it sets aside $52 billion in tax credits and funding for companies to expand stateside production.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-awarded-64-billion-chips-act-grant-to-build-semiconductor-ecosystem-in-texas-165414946.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

The <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52032524">International Data Corporation (IDC) Mobile Phone Tracker's preliminary data</a> for 2024's first quarter showed Samsung reclaiming the lead it has held since 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-annual-profits-continued-to-decline-in-2023-090500640.html">Samsung</a> has reportedly shipped 60.1 million units worldwide in quarter one, representing 20.8 percent of the market share. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-iphone-accessories-140022449.html">Apple</a> shipped 50.1 million units for 17.3 percent of the market share. Both companies saw a decrease from 2023's quarter one, though Apple's was much more significant (-9.6 percent) than Samsung's (-0.7 percent). The top five brands remained the same in quarter one as all of 2023, rounded out by Xiaomi with 40.8 million units, Transsion with 28.5 million units and OPPO with 25.2 million units shipped. Transsion overtook OPPO to enter fourth place.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The IDC points to these numbers as an indication that the smartphone market is strengthening. &quot;Firstly, we continue to see growth in value and average selling prices (ASPs) as consumers opt for more expensive devices knowing they will hold onto their devices longer. Secondly, there is a shift in power among the Top 5 companies, which will likely continue as market players adjust their strategies in a post-recovery world,&quot; said Nabila Popal, research director with IDC's Worldwide Tracker team in a statement. &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-xiaomi-14-pro-packs-a-faster-leica-camera-and-comes-in-a-titanium-edition-141515470.html">Xiaomi</a> is coming back strong from the large declines experienced over the past two years and Transsion is becoming a stable presence in the Top 5 with aggressive growth in international markets. In contrast, while the Top 2 players both saw negative growth in the first quarter, it seems Samsung is in a stronger position overall than they were in recent quarters.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/samsung-is-once-again-the-leader-in-global-smartphone-shipments-122528177.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

                                    <h3>Blackmagic's DaVinci Resolve 19 arrives with AI-powered motion tracking and color grading</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/blackmagics-davinci-resolve-19-arrives-with-ai-powered-motion-tracking-and-color-grading-090013746.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/blackmagics-davinci-resolve-19-arrives-with-ai-powered-motion-tracking-and-color-grading-090013746.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>Blackmagic Design released its annual NAB 2024 update and announced over a dozen new products, including a new version of its popular <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blackmagic-design-unveils-cloud-store-with-the-same-enclosure-as-its-e-gpu-205319361.html">DaVinci Resolve editing suite</a>. Other key products include the Micro Color Panel for DaVinci Resolve on iPad, a 17K 65mm camera and the Pyxis 6K cube camera.</p>
<h3>Davinci Resolve 19</h3>
<p>DaVinci Resolve has become a popular option for editors who don't want to pay a monthly subscription for Adobe's Premiere Pro, and is arguably more powerful in some ways. The latest version 19 takes a page from its rival, though, with a bunch of new AI-powered features for effects, color, editing, audio and more.&nbsp;</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img alt="Blackmagic's DaVinci Resolve 19 arrives with AI-powered tracking and color grading" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/fdf3c250-fafb-11ee-b77f-c9fcf3d78458" style="height: 1440px; width: 2560px;" /><figcaption>DaVinci Resolve 19 'Color Slice' tool</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Blackmagic Design</div></figure>
<p>Starting with the Edit module, a new feature lets you edit clips using text instead of video. Transcribing clips opens a window showing text detected from multiple speakers, letting you remove sections, search through text and more. Other features include a new trim window, fixed play head (reducing zooming and scrolling), a window that makes changing audio attributes faster and more.</p>
<p>The Color tool introduces "Color Slice," a way to adjust an image based on six vectors (red, green, blue, yellow, cyan and magenta) along with a special skin tone slider. For instance, you can adjust any of those specific colors, easily changing the levels of saturation and hues, while seeing and adjusting the underlying key. The dedicated skin slider will no doubt make it attractive for quick skin tone adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img alt="Blackmagic's DaVinci Resolve 19 arrives with AI-powered tracking and color grading" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/f9741bb0-fafd-11ee-8fdf-0c33dd02237d" style="height: 1440px; width: 2560px;" /><figcaption>DaVinci Resolve 19 Intellitrack</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Blackmagic Design</div></figure>
<p>Another key feature in Color is the "IntelliTrack" powered by a neural engine AI that lets you quickly select points to track to create effects or stabilize an image. Blackmagic also added a new Lightroom-like AI-powered noise reduction system that quickly removes digital noise or film grain from images with no user tweaking required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Film Look Creator" is a new module that opens up color grading possibilities with over 60 filmic parameters. It looks fairly easy to use, as you can start with a preset (default 65mm, cinematic, bleach bypass, nostalgic) and then tweak parameters to taste. Another new trick is "Defocus Background," letting users simulate a shallow depth of focus via masking in a realistic way (unlike smartphones), while Face Refinement tracks faces so editors tweak brightness, colors, detail and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Fusion FX editor adds some new tools that ease 3D object manipulation and on the audio (Fairlight) side, BMD introduced the "Dialogue Separator FX" to separate dialogue, background or ambience. DaVinci Resolve 19 is now in open beta for everyone to try, with no word yet on a date for the full release. As usual, <a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve">it costs $295 for the the Studio version</a> and the main version is free.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Micro Color Panel</h3>
<figure><img alt="Blackmagic's DaVinci Resolve 19 arrives with AI-powered tracking and color grading" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/efecbd40-fb02-11ee-9464-ac3ccab398b3" style="height: 547px; width: 1000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Blackmagic Design</div></figure>
<p>BMD's DaVinci Resolve for iPad proved to be a popular option for editors on the go, and now the company has introduced a dedicated control surface with the new Micro Color Panel. It'll offer editors control that goes well beyond the already decent Pencil and multitouch input, while keeping a relatively low profile at 7.18 x 14.33 inches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A slot at the top front lets you slide in your iPad, and from there you can connect via Bluetooth or USB-C. The company promises a "professional" feel to the controls, which consist of three weighted trackballs, 12 control dials and 27 buttons. With those, you can perform editors, tweak parameters like shadows, hues and highlights, and even do wipes and other effects.</p>
<p>"The old DaVinci Resolve Micro Panel model has been popular with customers wanting a compact grading panel, but we wanted to design an even more portable and affordable solution," said Blackmagic Design President Grant Petty. It's now on <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2MvcHJvZHVjdC8xODIzNTgwLVJFRy9ibGFja21hZ2ljX2Rlc2lnbl9ibGR2cm1jcF9kYXZpbmNpX3Jlc29sdmVfbWljcm9fY29sb3IuaHRtbCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGM3ZDQ1ODctMGQ3MC00ZWUzLTg5ZDUtZjVmYzkwN2Y5OTY5In0&amp;signature=AQAAASB0gkFbYTvQA_BMm1FgYWehPDQC7DLWNaXYx7grErUe&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1823580-REG%2Fblackmagic_design_bldvrmcp_davinci_resolve_micro_color.html">pre-order for $509</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Pyxis 6K camera</h3>
<figure><img alt="Blackmagic's DaVinci Resolve 19 arrives with AI-powered tracking and color grading" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/02b05bd0-fb03-11ee-97fe-1f4ca436201e" style="height: 547px; width: 1000px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Blackmagic Design</div></figure>
<p>Blackmagic Design is following rivals like RED, Sony and Panasonic with a new box-style camera, the Pyxis 6K full-frame camera. The idea is that you start with the basic brain (controls, display, CFexpress media, brain and sensor), then use side plates or mounting screws to attach accessories like handles, microphones and SSDs. It's also available with Blackmagic's URSA Cine EVF (electronic viewfinder) that adds $1,695 to the price.</p>
<p>Its specs are very similar to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmU0jIDZ4v8">Blackmagic Cinema Camera 6K</a> I tested late last year. The native resolution is 24-megapixels (6K) on a full 36 x 24mm sensor that allows for up to 13 stops of dynamic range with dual native ISO up to 25,600. It can record 12-bit Blackmagic RAW (BRAW) directly to the CFexpress Type B cards or an SSD.</p>
<p>It also supports direct streaming to YouTube, Facebook, Twitch and others via RTMP and SRT either via Ethernet or using a cellular connection. Since the streaming is built into the camera, customers and csee stream status and data rate directly in the viewfinder or LCD. The Pyxis 6K <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=95276f3c-7b79-4c1e-803f-981cd9f7a968&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=B%26H+Photo&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaHBob3RvdmlkZW8uY29tL2MvcHJvZHVjdC8xODIzNTg1LVJFRy9ibGFja21hZ2ljX2Rlc2lnbl9ibHB5eGlzNmtlZl9weXhpc182a19jaW5lbWFfYm94Lmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjBjN2Q0NTg3LTBkNzAtNGVlMy04OWQ1LWY1ZmM5MDdmOTk2OSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAaikuHKck5Im3RzwdLmJa-HLuh1YXtq2EmlAk4sYhpyL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1823585-REG%2Fblackmagic_design_blpyxis6kef_pyxis_6k_cinema_box.html">arrives in June for $2,995</a> with three mounts (Canon EF, Leica L and Arri PL).&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Blackmagic URSA Cine 12K and 17K</h3>
<figure><img alt="Blackmagic's DaVinci Resolve 19 arrives with AI-powered tracking and color grading" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/08e7eed0-fb05-11ee-bfdf-9d7b307c622d" style="height: 1440px; width: 2880px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Blackmagic Design</div></figure>
<p>Along with the Pyxis, Blackmagic introduced a pair of cinema cameras, the URSA Cine 12K and 17K models. Yes, those numbers represent the resolution of those two cameras, with the first offering a full-frame sensor 36 x 24mm with 12K resolution (12,888 x 6,480 17:9) at up a fairly incredible 100 fps. The second features a 65mm (50.8 x 23.3 sensor) with 17,520 x 8,040 resolution offering up to 16 stops of dynamic range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both models will come with features like built-in ND filters, an optical low pass filter and BMD's latest gen 5.0 color science. The URSA Cine 12K will come with 8TB of internal storage, or you can use your own CFexpress media. Other features include live streaming, a high-resolution EVF, V-battery support, wireless Bluetooth camera control and more.

                                    <h3>The best wireless workout headphones for 2024</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-workout-headphones-191517835.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-workout-headphones-191517835.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>Setting the mood with the right music can make working out easier and more enjoyable. Wireless workout headphones give you the freedom to do any kind of exercise you prefer, be it weight-lifting or skateboarding, untethered and in your own little world with your audio of choice. But if you plan on sweating or doing anything more vigorous than a brisk walk with your headphones, there are things to consider like water resistance, battery life and overall comfort. And if you want just one pair that you can use in and out of the gym, the decision can quickly get complicated. At Engadget, we’ve tested a bunch of fitness-ready headphones and earbuds to come up with our top picks, plus some advice to consider before you pick up a pair.</p>
<h2>What to look for in workout headphones</h2>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Before diving in, it’s worth mentioning that this guide focuses on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">wireless earbuds</a>. While you could wear over-ear or on-ear headphones during a workout, most of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html">best headphones</a> available now do not have the same level of durability. Water and dust resistance, particularly the former, is important for any audio gear you plan on sweating with or taking outdoors, and that’s more prevalent in the wireless earbuds world.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most earbuds have one of three designs: in-ear, in-ear with hook or open-ear. The first two are the most popular. In-ears are arguably the most common, while those with hooks promise better security and fit since they have an appendage that curls around the top of your ear. Open-ear designs don’t stick into your ear canal, but rather sit just outside of it. This makes it easier to hear the world around you while also listening to audio, and could be more comfortable for those who don’t like the intrusiveness of in-ear buds.</p>
<h3>Water resistance and dust protection</h3>
<p>Even if a pair of buds aren’t marketed specifically as workout headphones, a sturdy, water-resistant design will, by default, make them suitable for exercise. To avoid repetition, here’s a quick primer on durability, or ingression protection (IP) ratings. The first digit you’ll see after the “IP” refers to protection from dust and other potential intrusions, measured on a scale from 1 to 6. The second refers to water resistance or even waterproofing, in the best cases. The ratings for water resistance are ranked on a scale of 1 to 9; higher numbers mean more protection, while the letter “X” means the device is not rated for protection in that regard.</p>
<p>All of the earbuds we tested for this guide have at least an IPX4 rating, which means there’s no dust protection, but the buds can withstand splashes from any direction and are sweat resistant, but probably shouldn't be submerged. For a detailed breakdown of all the possible permutations, check out this guide published by a supplier called The Enclosure Company.</p>
<h3>Active noise cancellation and transparency mode</h3>
<p>Active noise cancellation (ANC) is becoming standard on wireless earbuds, at least those above a certain price point. If you’re looking for a pair of buds that can be your workout companion and serve you outside of the gym, too, noise cancelation is a good feature to have. It makes the buds more versatile, allowing you to block out the dull roar of your home or office so you can focus, or give you some solitude during a busy commute.</p>
<p>But an earbud’s ability to block out the world goes hand-in-hand with its ability to open things back up should you need it. Many ANC earbuds also support some sort of “transparency mode,” or various levels of noise reduction. This is important for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-for-running-120044637.html">running headphones</a> because exercising outdoors, alongside busy streets, can be dangerous. You probably don’t want to be totally oblivious to what’s going on around you when you’re running outside; adjusting noise cancelation levels to increase your awareness will help with that. Stronger noise cancelation might be more appealing to those doing more indoor training if they want to block out the dull roar of a gym or the guy exaggeratingly lifting weights next to you.</p>
<h3>Battery life</h3>
<p>All of the earbuds we tested have a battery life of six to eight hours. In general, that’s what you can expect from this space, with a few outliers that can get up to 15 hours of life on a charge. Even the low end of the spectrum should be good enough for most athletes and gym junkies, but it’ll be handy to keep the buds’ charging case on you if you think you’ll get close to using up all their juice during a single session.</p>
<p>You’ll get an average of 20 to 28 extra hours of battery out of most charging cases and all of the earbuds we tested had holders that provided at least an extra 15 hours. This will dictate how often you actually have to charge the device — as in physically connect the case with earbuds inside to a charging cable, or set it on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-charger-140036359.html">wireless charger</a> to power up.</p>
<h2>How we test</h2>
<p>In testing wireless workout headphones, I wear them during every bit of exercise I do — be it a casual walk around the block, a brisk morning run or a challenging weight-lifting session. I’m looking for comfort arguably most of all, because you should never be fussing with your earbuds when you should be focusing on working out. In the same vein, I’m cognizant of if they get loose during fast movements or slippery when I’m sweating. I also use the earbuds when not exercising to take calls and listen to music throughout the day. Many people will want just one pair of earbuds that they can use while exercising and just doing everyday things, so I evaluate each pair on their ability to be comfortable and provide a good listening experience in multiple different activities.</p>
<p>While I am also evaluating sound quality, I’m admittedly not an audio expert. My colleague Billy Steele holds that title at Engadget, and you’ll find much more detailed information about audio quality for some of our top picks in his reviews and buying guides. Here, however, I will make note of related issues if they stood out (i.e. if a pair of earbuds had noticeably strong bass out of the box, weak highs, etc). Most of the wireless workout headphones we tested work with companion apps that have adjustable EQ settings, so you’ll be able to tweak sound profiles to your liking in most cases.</p>

<h2>Others wireless workout headphones we tested</h2>
<h3>Apple AirPods Pro</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html">Apple AirPods Pro</a> have an IP54 rating, which protects them from brief encounters with dust and splashes. While that’s more dust protection than many other earbuds we tested, it’s the same level of water resistance that most exercise-specific competitors have. We generally like the AirPods Pro, but the Beats Fit Pro offer many of the same features and conveniences (namely good transparency mode and the H1 chip), with a design that’s more appropriate for working out.</p>
<h3>Beats Powerbeats Pro</h3>
<p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1Bvd2VyYmVhdHMtUHJvLVdpcmVsZXNzLUVhcnBob25lcy1IZWFkcGhvbmUvZHAvQjA3VzVKWkJWSi8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8ta2MtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU1NmJlMmUwLWRiOTYtMzI2ZC1iNTg3LWNhOWNlYTAwOTRjYiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAd4TYJhMcTOUD2bDDW_EttzYeT9ZtQwLXoynCfYhf0iJ&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPowerbeats-Pro-Wireless-Earphones-Headphone%2Fdp%2FB07W5JZBVJ%2F">Powerbeats Pro</a> are a good alternative to the Beats Fit Pro if you’re a stickler for a hook design. However, they cost $50 more than the Fit Pro (although they often hover around $180) and don’t offer any significant upgrades or additional features aside from their design. They’re also quite old at this point (launched in 2019) and it appears Beats is putting more effort into upgrading and updating its newer models rather than this model.</p>
<h3>Anker Soundcore AeroFit Pro</h3>
<p>The <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1NvdW5kY29yZS1IZWFkcGhvbmVzLUVyZ29ub21pYy1CbHVldG9vdGgtV2F0ZXItUmVzaXN0YW50L2RwL0IwQ0NSU1FHOEs_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy1wLW8ta2MtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjU1NmJlMmUwLWRiOTYtMzI2ZC1iNTg3LWNhOWNlYTAwOTRjYiJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATGSpUdrf6xf4Fb7rhthp_cCL5KuoSwXhowhvrMQfcRq&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSoundcore-Headphones-Ergonomic-Bluetooth-Water-Resistant%2Fdp%2FB0CCRSQG8K">Soundcore AeroFit Pro</a> is Anker’s version of the Shokz OpenFit, but I found it to be less secure and not as comfortable as the latter. The actual earbuds on the AeroFit Pro are noticeably bulkier than those on the OpenFit, which caused them to shift and move much more when I was wearing them during exercise. They never fell off my ears completely, but I spent more time adjusting them than I did enjoying them.</p>
<h3>JBL Endurance Peak 3</h3>
<p>The most noteworthy thing about the <a class="rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0pCTC1FbmR1cmFuY2UtUGVhay1XaXJlbGVzcy1IZWFkcGhvbmVzL2RwL0IwQlFQVzlSOUgvP3RhZz1nZGd0MGMtcC1vLWtjLTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1NTZiZTJlMC1kYjk2LTMyNmQtYjU4Ny1jYTljZWEwMDk0Y2IifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfEcf_vckeSXGjQdUggNVILGecyblw6zWSS7BvDsIPpz&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJBL-Endurance-Peak-Wireless-Headphones%2Fdp%2FB0BQPW9R9H%2F">Endurance Peak 3</a> is that they have the same IP68-rating that the Jabra Elite 8 Active do, but they only cost $100. But, while you get the same protection here, you’ll have to sacrifice in other areas. The Endurance Peak 3 didn’t blow me away when it came to sound quality or comfort (the hook is more rigid than those on my favorite buds of a similar style) and their charging case is massive compared to most competitors.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-workout-headphones-191517835.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

The camera is 25 percent off in both colors — black and white — in a deal on Amazon, bringing the already budget-friendly system down to just $30. The Blink Mini 2 can be used indoors or outdoors, offers HD footage in the daytime or at night and has an LED spotlight. It can be paired with one of Amazon’s smart displays for Alexa voice controls. The camera is a plug-in device, though, so you’ll need to place it somewhere with an outlet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You’ll also need to pick up the weather-resistant power adapter if you intend to put it outside.

Amazon-owned Blink <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blinks-new-mini-2-offers-a-built-in-spotlight-and-person-detection-for-40-130055057.html">announced the Mini 2 camera in March</a>, touting improvements to image quality and the option for HD night view in color thanks to its spotlight. The camera also has motion detection and two-way audio, so you can hear what’s going on and, if you want, let whoever’s on the other side hear you too.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the Blink subscription, you can get additional features out of the Mini 2. That includes smart notifications, like person detection, the ability to stream up to 90 minutes of live video and cloud storage for event clips.

                                    <h3>Playdate revisited: Two years with the little yellow inspiration machine</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/playdate-revisited-two-years-with-the-little-yellow-inspiration-machine-125517060.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/playdate-revisited-two-years-with-the-little-yellow-inspiration-machine-125517060.html?src=rss</a></p><p><div id="8eb22e1a4d914a28943d4506005d9d86"></div>
<p>Playdate came out two years ago, and it’s still miniscule and yellow with a black-and-white screen and a delightful crank on its side. Today, the device has a built-in library of more than 100 titles, none of which are Call of Duty, Dark Souls, The Last of Us or any other big-budget, mainstream game — and this is precisely what makes it so damn charming. The community that’s sprung up around this palmheld is lively and creative, and scrolling through the Playdate tags on itch.io or github feels like hanging out in a friendly underground clubhouse populated by crank-obsessed video game freaks.</p>
<p>It’s less disturbing than it sounds, I promise.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For real though, Playdate has only gotten cuter and more relevant with age. <em>Firewatch </em>publisher Panic and hardware studio Teenage Engineering unveiled the device in February 2019, pitching it as a sub-$200 handheld with a monochromatic screen, a crank and seasonal drops of free games. Pre-orders for Playdate opened in July 2021 and the plan was for shipments to start by the end of that year. However, in November, Panic discovered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panic-playdate-delay-2022-185543603.html">a severe battery issue</a> in its production line and the company was forced to swap suppliers and delay the release. Playdate officially landed in players’ hands in April 2022, and overall, reviewers found that it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playdate-review-indie-games-crank-170054294.html">entirely worth the wait</a>.</p>
<figure><img alt="Playdate" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/ab5a0430-f841-11ee-b5fe-2b76c0f48597" style="height: 1600px; width: 2800px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Panic</div></figure>
<p>Playdate shipped with 4GB of flash storage and 24 free games, including <em>Crankin’s Time Travel Adventure</em> from Keita Takahashi’s studio uvula and <em>Zipper</em> by Bennett Foddy. Playdate has always supported sideloading, too, meaning it’s easy to get titles from <a href="https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate">itch.io</a> and other distribution sites on the device. In March 2023, Playdate’s Catalog went live, offering a curated selection of 16 games for purchase. Panic also upped the price of Playdate from $179 to $199 at this time, citing rising manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>Today, Panic has sold roughly 70,000 Playdates and its Catalog features over 100 games, with more added regularly. Panic held a software showcase in February and the headliner was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucas-popes-mars-after-midnight-hits-the-playdate-console-on-march-12-193110110.html"><em>Mars After Midnight</em></a>, a Playdate-exclusive project from <em>Papers, Please </em>and <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em> creator Lucas Pope. <em>Mars After Midnight</em> came out on March 12, and Playdate had a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playdate-is-having-a-sitewide-games-sale-like-a-real-grown-up-console-203552312.html">big games sale</a> that week, just like a grown-up storefront would.</p>
<p>Two years post-launch, it’s clear that there’s no single formula for a Playdate game. <a href="https://play.date/games/chopter-copter/"><em>Chopter Copter</em></a>, for instance, turns the Playdate on its side and uses the crank as a helicopter-style rotor, spinning the propeller cap on a demon trapped in a gothic tower. Cranking controls this horned dude as he slices through flying enemies, leaving bits of meat and bone to fall out of the narrow frame. And then there are titles like <a href="https://play.date/games/word-trip/"><em>Word Trip</em></a>, a simple yet addictive letter-shifting game that I would recommend to all Wordle fans. Playdate supports first-person shooters, detective mysteries, bullet hells, shoot-em-ups, puzzle games, RPGs, pocket pets, rhythm situations, action-adventures, racing sims and all manner of subgenres, including some that have been invented just for the platform.</p>
<figure><img alt="Root Bear" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/aae47850-f83c-11ee-b877-63ea8da4d2b9" style="height: 240px; width: 400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Root Bear by TEAM ROOT</div></figure>
<p>Across Playdate’s UI and games, the crank transforms into hundreds of different tools. There are the standard iterations like crank to scroll and crank to buy, but there’s also crank to pour a drink, crank to fly, crank to fish, crank to spin a record, crank to build a city, crank to control time, crank to crank, crank to <em>survive</em>. Literally every game on Playdate reveals a new use case for the crank or helps demonstrate the absurd level of detail possible on a 400 x 240 1-bit display. Many games do both of these things — and <em>Mars After Midnight</em> is one of them.</p>
<p>As the creature in charge of a community room on a Martian colony, <em>Mars After Midnight </em>players crank open an observation window and identify the correct aliens for each session, while also providing snacks, cleaning up with two long tentacles and planning future support groups. Players use the crank to slam the room’s peephole open and shut, but the game also fully incorporates Playdate’s A and B buttons, D-pad and speaker, rolling out fresh mechanics at a steady pace. The game is populated by adorable, bumbling aliens and cartoonishly cute set pieces, and it even introduces an entire language.</p>
<p>Like the vast majority of Playdate games, <em>Mars After Midnight</em> doesn’t feel like a pared-down version of a bigger idea; it was simply meant to be a colorless, crank-powered experience.</p>
<figure><img alt="Mars After Midnight" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/d94d1da0-f83c-11ee-bbef-b4e99d8a76f3" style="height: 240px; width: 400px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mars After Midnight by Lucas Pope</div></figure>
<p>I’ve encountered one consistent issue with Playdate, and it’s something that I didn’t think would be a huge problem when I first reviewed it in 2022. The lack of backlight in its display is noticeable and occasionally annoying, particularly in low-light spaces. I often find myself tilting the screen toward a nearby window or lamp, and the device is pretty much unplayable on a dark plane or bus, or without a light source after sunset. If you remember trying to play an original Game Boy at night in the backseat of your parents’ car, waiting for the street lights to flicker past the window at regular intervals, it’s a lot like that. There’s a tinge of nostalgia here, but it’s mostly just kinda frustrating.</p>
<p>Playdate’s biggest issue, however, might be the Stereo Dock. Panic unveiled the Stereo Dock in mid-2021 — it’s a truly adorable charging stand, Bluetooth speaker and pen holder that matches Playdate’s pleasant yellow hue. I’ve wanted to plop one on my desk since it was announced, but the Stereo Dock has been “coming soon” for two years now.</p>
<p>It really is still coming, Playdate Project Lead Greg Maletic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-playdate-stereo-dock-got-stuck-in-factory-limbo-but-its-still-coming-010517171.html">told Engadget</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;We apologize to everyone with a Playdate who has been waiting patiently for the Stereo Dock; it’s been a trickier project than we anticipated and we had a few false starts,” Maletic said. “We thought we'd save some time on that project by having our factory do the software for the Stereo Dock, but we've learned that you don't always necessarily want that in some cases. The Stereo Dock is very much alive, we have the physical prototypes to prove it! We expect to have a formal update on when you can buy one later this year.&quot;</p>
<figure><img alt="Playdate Stereo Dock" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/ab545bb0-f83d-11ee-a5fe-3c6df1e78375" style="height: 1141px; width: 1792px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Panic</div></figure>
<p>If the worst thing about Playdate is the fact that people can’t get enough of it, then it sounds like things are going well. The device hasn’t faced any widespread recalls or hardware issues, its storefront is growing, its development pipeline is <a href="https://play.date/dev/">ridiculously easy to enter</a>, and people are still interested in buying it (and the Stereo Dock, one day).</p>
<p>With Playdate, Panic has created a new pocket of curious game enthusiasts, and it’s provided a platform for innovation that will ripple across all sectors of development. Playdate is a simple, small gaming machine with a single twist — a crank — and in its first two years on the market, it’s unearthed wells of creativity in the indie scene. By paring down the graphics and adding a new input method, Playdate changes the way we think about how games are played and made. As many of the industry’s most influential studios are trapped in a cycle of mass layoffs and regularly scheduled crunch, it’s a fantastic time to rethink what we’re all actually doing here. Playdate makes this process natural, accessible and entertaining.</p>
<figure><img alt="Playdate" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/67690ec0-bf2b-11ec-a67f-c5abd77f5d24" style="height: 1500px; width: 2500px;" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Panic</div></figure>
<p>A device like Playdate doesn’t just happen. I wouldn’t be worried about revisiting this thing two years post-launch if it were too underpowered, overcomplicated or unserious, but this isn’t a funny gimmick from a company on a press tour. The sense of elegance, care and proper prioritization built into Playdate is what makes it a blank canvas for so many different styles of game development. Playdate is a little yellow inspiration machine; it’s a physical reset button for the entire industry. Actually, I guess it’s a reset crank.</p>
<p>Go on, turn it. It’s so much fun.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/playdate-revisited-two-years-with-the-little-yellow-inspiration-machine-125517060.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

                                    <h3>The best tablets for 2024</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-tablets-150026056.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/best-tablets-150026056.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>A tablet can make a great addition to your tech toolkit. It can replace an e-reader, serve as a more portable laptop replacement or simply be a shared device for watching movies or checking social media at home. However, with four different families of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html">iPad</a>, a plethora of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-android-tablet-120007530.html">Android</a> options and Windows-based alternatives like the Surface Pro, it can be difficult to figure out which will serve you best. We at Engadget have tested and reviewed dozens of tablets over the years, and we continue to try out the latest models asa they hit the market. Below, we've solidified our current top picks, plus all of the information you should know before picking up the best tablet for you.<br /><br /><strong>Editor's Note (April 2024):</strong> For anyone thinking about buying a new tablet, you may want to hold off for another few months. Interesting Android options like the TCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcls-nxtpaper-14-pro-is-somewhere-between-a-tablet-and-a-giant-e-reader-190047895.html">which we saw back at CES</a> have yet to go on sale. Meanwhile, we’re still waiting for Apple to release a new generation of iPads after not updating or refreshing any of its tablets in 2023. This is really unusual as this is the first time Apple hasn’t released a new iPad in a calendar year since the original came out back in 2010. There isn’t an exact timetable for when new models may appear, but rumors suggest we should learn more between now and WWDC in June. Finally, while Microsoft did recently update the Surface family <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-surface-pro-10-and-surface-laptop-6-are-here-but-you-wont-find-them-in-stores-160022629.html">with a new Surface Pro 10 model</a>, that device is specially targeted at enterprise buyers and it won’t be available from traditional retailers. So if you’re hoping to avoid buyer’s remorse after purchasing a new tablet that might get replaced real soon, you’ll want to exercise patience until new products get announced later this spring and summer.</p>
<h2>Which OS is right for me?</h2>
<p>Before you even start looking at specific devices, consider how your new tablet will fit in with the gadgets you already own, and how you plan to use it. For example, if everyone in your house uses Macs and iPhones, it probably doesn’t make a lot of sense to buy an Android tablet, even if you’ve been tempted by the massive 14.6-inch screen on the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review-a-little-too-big-a-little-too-expensive-150026015.html">Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra.</a> This goes double for anyone with an extensive library of purchased videos and music that might be harder to access after switching platforms.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another consideration is the kind of work you’ll be doing. That’s because while most modern tablets are adept at browsing websites or playing games, some operating systems like iPadOS and Windows 11 are better designed to support multitasking and productivity than Android or even Chrome OS. It’s a similar situation for software, because while most popular apps and games are available on both Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store, more specialized software may only have proper support on desktop platforms like Windows or macOS.</p>
<h2>What size screen should I get?</h2>
<p>Figuring out the best screen size for you will also be related to the kind of work (or play) you intend to do. Larger displays make it much easier to view two apps side by side, and big screens also deliver a more immersive movie viewing experience. But at the same time, the larger the tablet, the less likely you’re going to want to move it around. That means you’re not only going to want to take stock of your workspace (i.e., if you have a desk or instead plan to work from a couch or even your bed), you’re also going to want to think about how the device will fit into your everyday routine or commute (if you have one).</p>
<h2>Potential accessories</h2>
<p>Finally, you’ll want to consider any add-ons or accessories you’re planning to use, which can range from detachable keyboards to things like external mics or a stylus. The good news is that many of the best tablets nowadays offer some kind of keyboard accessory, which allows the device to function more like a 2-in-1 instead of simply being a content consumption device. Some tablets also feature things like microSD card slots that support expandable storage, or optional 4G or 5G connectivity, which can be a real boon to frequent travelers. And if you’re planning to use the tablet mainly for work, you might want to grab a USB hub for connecting all your favorite peripherals.</p>
<h2>How we test</h2>
<p>When evaluating different tablets, there are a few important things we look for above all else: solid performance, a good screen and long battery life. For performance, we run a handful of synthetic tests like Geekbench 6, while also performing a number of real-world use cases such as editing photos and playing games. And with tablets often serving as hybrid devices, we also consider how easy it is to multitask and switch quickly between various apps. The more responsive a device feels, the better.</p>
<p>Because a tablet’s display is such a critical component, we also view a wide range of content to gauge things like brightness, color gamut and dynamic range. It’s important to take into account the difference between various panel types like OLED, which typically produce richer colors and excellent contrast but may not be as bright as a mini LED display. Recently, refresh rate has become an increasingly important spec as 90Hz and 120Hz screens can make scrolling smoother and graphics appear sharper in games.</p>
<p>We also consider a tablet’s design (including things like size, weight and water resistance), its connectivity (WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, 5G, et cetera) and special features like stylus support or the ability to serve as a secondary display. That’s because, while tablets were often viewed as content consumption devices in the past, higher-end devices like the Surface Pro and iPad Pro are more than capable of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html">replacing a laptop</a> for a lot of people.</p>
<p>Finally, we test battery life by running our standard local video rundown test, which involves playing a single video on a loop from 100 percent until it runs out of juice. Ideally, a tablet should be able to last an entire working day, but longer runtimes are always welcome.</p>

<h2>Other tablets we tested</h2>
<h3>Apple iPad Air</h3>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-5th-generation-review-130019050.html">iPad Air</a> is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html">best iPad for most people</a>, the iPad Pro is the model that showcases the best of what Apple has to offer in the tablet space. The Air has a similar design to the Pro, but it runs on an M1 chip and the base model comes with only 64GB of storage. Those with tight budgets can consider the Air a  good alternative to the Pro, and it'll be particularly tempting if you see it on sale.</p>
<h3>Google Pixel Tablet</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-tablet-review-clever-accessories-transform-an-unexciting-tablet-070147119.html">Google Pixel Tablet</a> excels as a smart display rather than a simple tablet. As the latter, it's unexciting, but when paired with its speaker/charging dock, it becomes much more useful. It could be a good option for those that already live within the Google ecosystem and use the Google Assistant often, or those who like the idea of a tablet that can be docked and used as a smart display as well.</p>
<h3>OnePlus Pad</h3>
<p>The solid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-pad-review-solid-hardware-thats-let-down-by-android-130039695.html">OnePlus Pad</a> is let down by Android because there aren't many Android apps designed to be used on a large display like this model's 11.6-inch panel. Otherwise, the hardware is well-designed, its companion stylus is comfortable to use and it has an excellent battery life.</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3>What is the best brand for tablets?</h3>
<p>The best brand for tablets is really the brand you feel most comfortable with. We recommend taking stock of the gadgets you already have — do you live in the Apple ecosystem already? An iPad might be best for you then. Do you have a Samsung phone? If so, a Galaxy Tab will likely be the most convenient choice. There is no one &quot;best brand&quot; for tablets; you’ll find good options made by companies including Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Amazon.</p>
<h3>Can a tablet replace a laptop?</h3>
<p>It’s possible for a tablet to replace a laptop, but you’ll need a few accessories to truly make the experience as close as possible to that of a traditional notebook. A keyboard is a must, be it a keyboard case or a Bluetooth accessory that you keep with you. Some keyboard cases, like apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad, have a built-in trackpad, which will be more ergonomic than tapping on your tablet’s screen for input. Additionally, you could go one step further and use a wireless mouse that connects via Bluetooth to your tablet. If you’re primarily looking for a tablet to replace your laptop, consider buying a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html">2-in-1 laptop</a> since those systems typically consist of high-powered tablets that are designed to work well with (and without) keyboards.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-tablets-150026056.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

                                    <h3>The best laptops for 2024</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html?src=rss">https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html?src=rss</a></p><p><p>We’ve kicked off 2024 with a slew of new processors from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-14th-gen-hx-cpu-launch-230005176.html">Intel</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-reveals-rtx-40-super-gpus-at-ces-2024-163041585.html">NVIDIA</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-brings-ai-to-ryzen-8000g-desktop-chips-at-ces-2024-153032800.html">AMD</a>, which means there should be plenty of refreshed laptops on the horizon. This year, the term you’ll probably hear the most is AI PCs, that is, computers with neural processors designed to speed up AI tasks. While it’s not necessary for you to buy a laptop just for the sake of AI this year, it’s a good thing to keep an eye on for future-proofing as more companies bring the likes of Microsoft’s Copilot or ChatGPT to their systems. Some notebooks even have dedicated Copilot buttons on the keyboard to make it easier to summon generative AI help.<br /><br />Even if you’re willing to wait out the AI hype while you shop for your new laptop, there are still plenty of other specs to consider. Should you pay extra for more memory, or get a notebook with a larger screen? We've tested and reviewed dozens of the latest laptops, including Apple's latest M3 MacBook Air, to come up with top picks for the best laptops you can buy right now, along with buying advice that will hopefully help demystify the market.</p>
<h2>What to consider before buying a laptop</h2>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>You probably have an idea of your budget, but just so you know, most modern laptops with top-of-the-line specs cost between $1,800 to $2,000 these days. That doesn’t mean you won’t find a good system for under $1,000 — a grand is the base price for a lot of premium 13-inch ultraportables, with chips like Intel’s Core i3 or i5 series. And if that’s too expensive, you’ll still have respectable options in the $600 to $800 range, but they might come with older, slower processors and dimmer screens. You could also consider configurations with AMD’s processors, which have become more reliable and speedy in recent years, while sometimes costing less. I’ve included our favorite budget-friendly model in this best laptop buying guide but we have a list of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-laptop-150038435.html">more-affordable laptop picks</a> that you can check out as well.</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h3>Operating system: Apple, Windows or Chrome OS</h3>
<p>After working out how much money you want to spend, your next decision is what operating system to choose. As expected, that’s slightly easier for people who prefer an Apple MacBook. Now that the company has brought its M-series chips to the whole lineup, with the Pro models sporting the third generation of those processors — your only real considerations are budget, screen size and how much power you need.</p>
<p>Over on Team Windows, however, the shift to ARM-based chips hasn’t been as smooth and it’s quite unlikely you’ll be considering one in 2024. Though Apple laptops have been able to bring huge increases in battery life while maintaining (and in some cases improving) performance with their own silicon, PC makers have been limited by Windows’ shortcomings. For now, it’s still safer to stick with an Intel or AMD processor.</p>
<p>As for whether you want a PC with a dedicated AI button on the keyboard, that depends on how often you see yourself using Microsoft’s CoPilot generative tools. Given we’re only just seeing the first slate of AI PCs, it would be wiser to wait out the hype and see what improvements might come over time.</p>
<p>Finally, if you don’t really need your laptop for a lot of complicated tasks and mostly want it for Netflix, shopping and Google Docs, it’s worth remembering there’s a third and fairly popular laptop operating system: Chrome OS. If you do most of your work in a browser, then a Chromebook might be good enough, and they’re usually more affordable, too.</p>

 </figcaption></figure>
<h3>Connectivity</h3>
<p>It’s worth pointing out that some recent models have done away with headphone jacks. While this doesn’t seem to be a prevalent trend yet, it’s a good reminder to check that a machine has all the connectors you need (otherwise, you'll have to spend more money on the necessary adapters). Most laptops in 2024 offer WiFi 6 or 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 or later, which should mean faster and more stable connections if you have compatible routers and devices. While 5G coverage is more widespread now, whether you need support for that depends on how much you travel and your need for constant connectivity sans-Wi-Fi.</p>
<h3>Display size</h3>
<p>Where you plan on taking your laptop also helps in deciding what size to get. Many companies launched new 14-inch machines in the last year, straddling the line between ultraportable and bulkier 15-inch laptops. For most people, a 14-inch screen is a great middle ground. But if you’re worried about weight and want a more portable laptop, a 12- or 13-inch model will be better. Those that want more powerful processors and larger displays will prefer 15- or 16-inch versions.</p>

<h2>Other laptops we tested</h2>
<h3>Apple 15-inch MacBook Air M3</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-air-m3-review-2024-13-15-inch-140053162.html">This Apple laptop</a> is just a larger version of the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air. It's still quite portable at 3.3 pounds, and some will appreciating having just a tad more screen real estate all the time. Configuration options are the same as well; you can spec out the 15-inch Air with up to 24GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. But considering it starts off $200 more than the smaller model, it's primarily best for those who absolutely need a larger screen and are willing to pay for it.</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3>What is the average battery life of a laptop per charge?</h3>
<p>Battery life will vary depending on the type of laptop you have and what you use it for. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">Gaming laptops</a> have some of the shorter average battery lives in the notebook space because playing laborious titles causes battery to drain faster. You can expect between five and eight hours of life on a single charge with most gaming laptops, but don't be surprised if you actually get less use per charge if you're doing heavy things with it. As for regular laptops, you can expect roughly ten hours of life on the best models, but some will fall on the lower and higher ends of the spectrum.</p>
<h3>What is the best storage capacity for a laptop?</h3>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to laptop storage. Most of the best laptops will have configurations with 128GB, 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage options, and we think most people will be served best by either of the two middle options: 256GB of 512GB. If you use your laptop to store tons of documents and files, or photos and videos, we recommend springing for extra built-in storage or investing in a portable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ssds-140014262.html">SSD</a> with which you can backup your most important files. It's also worth noting that Chromebooks tend to come with less built-in storage — 32GB, 64GB or 128GB — since Chrome OS encourages users to save their files in the cloud rather than on a device.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html?src=rss</p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

                                    <h3>Apple's First AI Features in iOS 18 Reportedly Won't Use Cloud Servers</h3><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/apples-first-ios-18-ai-features-no-cloud/">https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/apples-first-ios-18-ai-features-no-cloud/</a></p><p>Apple's first set of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new AI features planned for iOS 18</a> will not rely on cloud servers at all, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-14/humane-ai-pin-review-the-device-isn-t-going-to-kill-apple-s-iphone-luziqlew"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945741" height="1406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-Siri-Integrated-Feature.jpg" width="2500" />
<br />
"As the world awaits Apple's big AI unveiling on June 10, it looks like the initial wave of features will work entirely on device," said Gurman, in the Q&amp;A section of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-14/humane-ai-pin-review-the-device-isn-t-going-to-kill-apple-s-iphone-luziqlew"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today. "That means there's no cloud processing component to the company's large language model, the software that powers the new capabilities."
<br />

<br />
Apple will probably still offer some cloud-based AI features powered by Google's Gemini or another provider, according to Gurman. Apple has reportedly held discussions with companies <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-generative-ai-google-openai-baidu/">such as Google, OpenAI, and China's Baidu</a> about potential generative AI partnerships. iOS 18 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/ios-18-reportedly-wont-have-apple-chatbot/">not expected to include Apple's own ChatGPT-like chatbot</a>, but it is unclear if Gemini or other chatbot will be directly integrated into iOS 18.
<br />

<br />
It is possible that Apple could offer some of its own cloud-based generative AI features in the future, as Apple supply chain analysts like Ming-Chi Kuo and Jeff Pu have said that the company is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-ai-server-spending-2024/">actively purchasing AI servers</a>.
<br />

<br />
iOS 18 is rumored to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new generative AI features</a> for the iPhone's Spotlight search tool, Siri, Safari, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more. Gurman previously reported that generative AI will improve Siri's ability to answer more complex questions, and allow the Messages app to auto-complete sentences.
<br />

<br />
Apple is expected to unveil iOS 18 and other software updates at its annual developers conference WWDC, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/">runs from June 10 through June 14</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/apples-first-ios-18-ai-features-no-cloud/">Apple&#039;s First AI Features in iOS 18 Reportedly Won&#039;t Use Cloud Servers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-ai-features-in-ios-18-reportedly-wont-use-cloud-servers.2424167/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

                                    <h3>X May Charge New Users a 'Small Fee' to Post, Like and Reply</h3><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/x-small-fee-new-users/">https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/x-small-fee-new-users/</a></p><p>Social media platform X (formerly Twitter) will soon begin charging new users "a small fee" for posting content and liking, replying, and bookmarking tweets, according to Elon Musk.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904140" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/X-twitter-logo.jpg" width="1920" />
<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/xDaily/status/1779927679493411209">X Daily News</a>, a feed that posts X updates, today noticed that text strings on the website have been updated to mention a small annual fee that new users will need to pay in order to access the social network.
<br />

<br />
Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1779930065469383166">said in response</a> that the fee for new users is "the only way to curb the relentless onslaught of bots."
<br />

<br />
The fee has previously been tested in New Zealand and the Philippines, and Musk says that it is applicable only to those who are new to Twitter. When a new user signs up, the user will need to pay the fee, or wait for three months to be able to engage on the network. The updated language on the Twitter site:
<br />
<blockquote>New accounts are required to pay a small annual fee before you're able to post, like, bookmark, and reply. This is to reduce spam and create a better experience for everyone. You can still follow accounts and browse X for free.</blockquote>
<br />
The text does not mention being able to post for free after three months, but <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1779939517278957714">Musk confirmed</a> that "write actions" would be free after that time period.
<br />

<br />
It is unclear how the policy will stop spam accounts and bots, as spammers will be able to pay the fee or simply create multiple accounts and wait to be able to post. Regular users, meanwhile, could be discouraged from using X due to the extra step and the fact that other social networks are free.
<br />

<br />
The fee appears to be around &#36;1, as it costs &#36;1.75 NZD in New Zealand. The pay-for-access policy has not yet been implemented outside of New Zealand and the Philippines.
<br />

<br />
Musk said that fake accounts also use up "the available namespace" limiting the "good handles." X has freed up over a million usernames so far, and will "free up tens of millions in the coming weeks."<br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/x-small-fee-new-users/">X May Charge New Users a &#039;Small Fee&#039; to Post, Like and Reply</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/x-may-charge-new-users-a-small-fee-to-post-like-and-reply.2424255/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

<h2 id="will_it_be_worth_upgrading">Will It Be Worth Upgrading?</h2>
<br />
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; was a fairly significant upgrade over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro in 2023, introducing a new design with a titanium frame, slimmer bezels, the Action button, a USB-C port, and more. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;'s upgrades will likely not be as substantial as those offered by its predecessor. As a result, most &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; users will have little reason to upgrade, but some who would appreciate a larger display, better cameras, and a dedicated button for photography and videography features may find it worthwhile.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro vs. iPhone 16 Pro: 30 Rumored Upgrades Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro-30-rumored-upgrades-compared.2419268/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

                                    <h3>Browser Companies Criticize Apple's EU Choice Screen in iOS 17.4</h3><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/12/apple-eu-default-browser-options-criticized/">https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/12/apple-eu-default-browser-options-criticized/</a></p><p>Several third-party browser companies have experienced a spike in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> installs since Apple made major changes to iOS in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act in the European Union, but many are not happy with Apple's implementation of its default browser choice screen.
<br />

<br />
<img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941009" height="1080" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/alternative-browser-list-eu.jpg" width="1920" />
<br />
In iOS 17.4, released last month, Apple no longer limits EU users to the handful of browser options that iOS currently offers as alternatives in other parts of the world. Instead, users in the EU who open Safari for the first time are presented with a choice screen that allows them to opt for a new default browser from a list of popular alternatives in their country.
<br />

<br />
The change has led to a sharp increase in third-party browser usage, based on several reports. On Wednesday, <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eus-new-tech-laws-are-working-small-browsers-gain-market-share-2024-04-10/">Reuters</a></em> reported that users of privacy-first browser Aloha had jumped 250% in March. The jump in users largely came in France, Belgium (3x growth), Germany, The Netherlands, Spain and Sweden (2.5x growth), and Denmark, Italy and Poland (2x growth).
<br />

<br />
Aloha browser markets itself as a privacy focused alternative to browsers that earns its money through paid subscriptions rather than selling ads by tracking users. The Cyprus-based company says it has 10 million monthly average users.
<br />

<br />
"Before, EU was our number four market, right now it's number two," Aloha CEO Andrew Frost Moroz said in an interview with <em>Reuters</em>.
<br />

<br />
Norway's Vivaldi browser, Germany's Ecosia and U.S.-based Brave have all seen user numbers rise following the new regulation. U.S.-based DuckDuckGo, which has about 100 million users, and its more popular rival, Norway-based Opera, have also reported substantial increases.
<br />

<br />
To be eligible for consideration in the alternative browsers list, companies must have the Default Browser Entitlement that is available to developers. Apple also requires that the app has been downloaded by at least 5,000 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users‌ across all 27 EU countries in the prior calendar year. Apple selects up to 11 of these for the browser choice screen in addition to Safari, updating the list once per calendar year. 
<br />

<br />
Google has also updated its Pixel software to show alternative browser choices, and says that new Android devices made by other companies will also display the choice screen in the coming months.
<br />

<br />
Despite users increasingly choosing alternative options, browser companies have criticized Apple and Google for the slow rollout of the change, and believe it is hampering the migration away from Safari and Chrome. Mozilla, which owns Firefox, estimates that only around a fifth of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in the EU have received the iOS update, and claims that the rollout is much slower than Apple's previous software updates.
<br />

<br />
Some alternative browser makers are also concerned that the design of choice screens is sub-optimal at best. For example, Vivaldi CEO Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner notes that Apple's choice screen only appears when &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users open Safari, while the list of browsers provides no additional information. 
<br />

<br />
"The process is just so convoluted that it's easiest for (users) to select Safari or potentially some other known name," he told <em>Reuters</em>.
<br />

<br />
Vivaldi is also unhappy with the design. "The list of browsers does not show additional information and that does not help users to make a meaningful choice," a company spokesperson told <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/eu-dma-browser-choice-screen-early-impact/">TechCrunch</a></em>. "If the user has already selected a browser of their own choice, the choice screen can actively try to push them away from it, and may not even include it in the list that it presents to the user."
<br />

<br />
Ecosia has also been critical, and says Apple's implementation involves an "overly complex installation process" and keeps Safari front and center on the user's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Home screen.
<br />

<br />
The European Commission is currently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/eu-to-investigate-apple-dma-compliance/">investigating</a> Apple's choice screen design for suspected noncompliance. The probe is being conducted in consultation with browser companies, who are likely to encourage regulators to push for a stronger implementation to level the competitive playing field. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/12/apple-eu-default-browser-options-criticized/">Browser Companies Criticize Apple&#039;s EU Choice Screen in iOS 17.4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/browser-companies-criticize-apples-eu-choice-screen-in-ios-17-4.2424048/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

"These new Firefly tools -- alongside some proposed third-party integrations with Runway, Pika Labs, and OpenAI's Sora models -- will allow Premiere Pro users to generate video and add or remove objects using text prompts (just like Photoshop's Generative Fill feature) and extend the length of video clips," reports The Verge. From the report: Unlike many of Adobe's previous Firefly-related announcements, no release date -- beta or otherwise -- has been established for the company's new video generation tools, only that they'll roll out "this year." And while the creative software giant showcased what its own video model is currently capable of in an early video demo, its plans to integrate Premiere Pro with AI models from other providers isn't a certainty. Adobe instead calls the third-party AI integrations in its video preview an "early exploration" of what these may look like "in the future." The idea is to provide Premiere Pro users with more choice, according to Adobe, allowing them to use models like Pika to extend shots or Sora or Runway AI when generating B-roll for their projects. Adobe also says its Content Credentials labels can be applied to these generated clips to identify which AI models have been used to generate them.<p><div class="share_submission">

AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all. AI has surpassed human performance on several benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning. 
2. Industry continues to dominate frontier AI research. In 2023, industry produced 51 notable machine learning models, while academia contributed only 15. There were also 21 notable models resulting from industry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high. 
3. Frontier models get way more expensive. According to AI Index estimates, the training costs of state-of-the-art AI models have reached unprecedented levels. For example, OpenAI's GPT-4 used an estimated $78 million worth of compute to train, while Google's Gemini Ultra cost $191 million for compute.
4. The United States leads China, the EU, and the U.K. as the leading source of top AI models. In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from U.S.-based institutions, far outpacing the European Union's 21 and China's 15. 
5. Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking. New research from the AI Index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting. Leading developers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, primarily test their models against different responsible AI benchmarks. This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations of top AI models. 
6. Generative AI investment skyrockets. Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last year, funding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. Major players in the generative AI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial fundraising rounds. 
7. The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work. In 2023, several studies assessed AI's impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks more quickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI's potential to bridge the skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still, other studies caution that using AI without proper oversight can lead to diminished performance. 
8. Scientific progress accelerates even further, thanks to AI. In 2022, AI began to advance scientific discovery. 2023, however, saw the launch of even more significant science-related AI applications -- from AlphaDev, which makes algorithmic sorting more efficient, to GNoME, which facilitates the process of materials discovery. 
9. The number of AI regulations in the United States sharply increases. The number of AIrelated regulations in the U.S. has risen significantly in the past year and over the last five years. In 2023, there were 25 AI-related regulations, up from just one in 2016. Last year alone, the total number of AI-related regulations grew by 56.3%. 
10. People across the globe are more cognizant of AI's potential impact -- and more nervous. A survey from Ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think AI will dramatically affect their lives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. Moreover, 52% express nervousness toward AI products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. In America, Pew data suggests that 52% of Americans report feeling more concerned than excited about AI, rising from 37% in 2022.<p><div class="share_submission">

From the report: Policy officials at the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology are in the early stages of devising legislation to limit potential harms caused by the emerging technology, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing undeveloped proposals. No bill is imminent, and the government is likely to wait until France hosts an AI conference either later this year or early next to launch a consultation on the topic, they said. 

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who hosted the first world leaders' summit on AI last year and has repeatedly said countries shouldn't "rush to regulate" AI, risks losing ground to the US and European Union on imposing guardrails on the industry. The EU passed a sweeping law to regulate the technology earlier this year, companies in China need approvals before producing AI services and some US cities and states have passed laws limiting use of AI in specific areas.<p><div class="share_submission">

Stanford University professor of civil and environmental engineering Mark Z. Jacobson has been tracking California's renewables performance, and he shares his findings on Twitter (X) when the state breaks records. Jacobson notes that supply exceeds demand for "0.25-6 h per day," and that's an important fact. The continuity lies not in renewables running the grid for the entire day but in the fact that it's happening on a consistent daily basis, which has never been achieved before.
 
At the two-week record mark, Ian Magruder at Rewiring America made this great point on LinkedIn: "And what makes it even better is that California has the largest grid-connected battery storage facility in the world (came online in January ...), meaning those batteries were filling up with excess energy from the sun all afternoon today and are now deploying as we speak to offset a good chunk of the methane gas generation that California still uses overnight." On April 2, the California Independent System Operator (ISO) recommended 26 new transmission projects worth $6.1 billion, with a big number being devoted to offshore wind. In response, Jacobson predicted on April 4 that California will entirely be on renewables and battery storage 24/7 by 2035.<p><div class="share_submission">

The Register reports: Credential stuffing and password spraying are both fairly similar types of brute force attacks, but the former uses known pairs of credentials (usernames and passwords). The latter simply spams common passwords at known usernames in the hope one of them leads to an authenticated session. "There is no indication that Roku was the source of the account credentials used in these attacks or that Roku's systems were compromised in either incident," it said in an update to customers. "Rather, it is likely that login credentials used in these attacks were taken from another source, like another online account, where the affected users may have used the same credentials."
 
All accounts now require 2FA to be implemented, whether they were affected by the wave of compromises or not. Roku has more than 80 million active accounts, so only a minority were affected, and these have all been issued mandatory password resets. Compromised or not, all users are encouraged to create a strong, unique password for their accounts, consisting of at least eight characters, including a mix of numbers, symbols, and letter cases. [...] Roku also asked users to remain vigilant to suspicious activity regarding its service, such as phishing emails or clicking on dodgy links to rest passwords -- the usual stuff. "In closing, we sincerely regret that these incidents occurred and any disruption they may have caused," it said. "Your account security is a top priority, and we are committed to protecting your Roku account."<p><div class="share_submission">

To the uninitiated, it may seem absurd to go to a massive sports arena and watch people play D&amp;D. As one Redditor commented, "This boggles my mind. When I was playing D&amp;D in the early eighties, I would have never believed that there was a future where people would watch live D&amp;D at Madison Square Garden. It's incomprehensible to me." It is indeed bizarre, albeit fun. But in this monumental moment for the actual play genre, the triumph is eclipsed by the biggest frustration that links sports, music and now D&amp;D fans: Ticketmaster. As Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan said amid the Taylor Swift-Ticketmaster scandal, the company's failures "ended up converting more Gen Zers into anti-monopolists overnight than anything [she] could have done."
 
In the case of Taylor Swift's Eras tour, fans were upset because demand was so high that Ticketmaster's system couldn't handle the traffic. For Dimension 20, the culprit is Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing. As more people try to buy tickets, the price of the tickets increase. About an hour after the Madison Square Garden tickets went on sale, the few dozen upper bowl tickets left were $800. Three hours after, these tickets are around $330, which is still very inflated. "Went onto the presale, tickets were $500+ for the worst ones, we assumed they were scalpers and that the actual sale today would have normal priced tickets $2000 for the lower bowl!? I know it's not dropout setting the price but wow is that a LOT of cash," a Redditor posted. And as a commenter astutely pointed out, thanks to dynamic pricing, Ticketmaster itself is actually the scalper. Of course, Dimension 20 fans are frustrated, especially since the show's content is overtly anti-capitalist. Despite the pricing debacle, the demand for the show is a great sign for both actual play shows and the creator economy at large.<p><div class="share_submission">
