## DonkeyFeed

DonkeyFeed is a simple tool for filtering RSS feeds based on keywords. It lets you save a list of feed names, URLs, and keywords so you can run a search and save the results anytime you want.

## Installation

Honestly haven't figured it out yet, but check back in a week.

## Running DonkeyFeed

You can run DonkeyFeed from the terminal using Python. Navigate to the folder ../DonkeyFeed/main/ and type:

```
python3 donkeyfeed.py
```
