Stability AI claimed that the new model, which isn’t widely available yet, improves image quality, works better with prompts containing multiple subjects, and can more accurate text as part of the generated image, something that previous Stable Diffusion models weren’t great at.<br /><br />Stability AI CEO Emad Mosque posted some examples of this on X.<br /></p>

<p><br />The announcement comes days after Stability AI’s largest rival, OpenAI, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/openais-new-sora-model-can-generate-minute-long-videos-from-text-prompts-195717694.html">unveiled Sora</a>, a brand new AI model capable of generating nearly-realistic, high-definition videos from simple text prompts. Sora, which isn’t available to the general public yet either, sparked concerns about its potential to create realistic-looking fake footage. OpenAI said it's working with experts in misinformation and hateful content to test the tool before making it widely available.Stability AI said it’s doing the same. “[We] have taken and continue to take reasonable steps to prevent the misuse of Stable Diffusion 3 by bad actors,” the company wrote in a blog post on its website. “By continually collaborating with researchers, experts, and our community, we expect to innovate further with integrity as we approach the model’s public release.” <br /><br />It’s not clear when Stable Diffusion 3 will be released to the public, but until then, anyone interested can join <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="http://stability.ai/stablediffusion3">a waitlist</a>.</p>

The move comes after viral social posts showed the AI tool overcorrecting for diversity, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-promises-to-fix-geminis-image-generation-following-complaints-that-its-woke-073445160.html">producing “historical” images of Nazis, America’s Founding Fathers and the Pope </a>as people of color.</p>
<p>“We’re already working to address recent issues with Gemini’s image generation feature,” Google <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/Google_Comms/status/1760603321944121506">posted</a> on X (<a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/technology/google-gemini-german-uniforms.html">via</a> <em>The New York Times</em>). “While we do this, we’re going to pause the image generation of people and will re-release an improved version soon.”</p>
<span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The X user @JohnLu0x <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/JohnLu0x/status/1760170103474356519">posted</a> screenshots of Gemini’s results for the prompt, “Generate an image of a 1943 German Solidier.” (Their misspelling of “Soldier” was intentional to trick the AI into bypassing its content filters to generate otherwise blocked Nazi images.) The generated results appear to show Black, Asian and Indigenous soldiers wearing Nazi uniforms.</p>
<div id="92a1c683d3fa403283ccbd47ed774119"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Still real real broke <a href="https://t.co/FrPBrYi47v">pic.twitter.com/FrPBrYi47v</a></p>— John L.

<p>Other social users criticized Gemini for producing images for the prompt, “Generate a glamour shot of a [ethnicity] couple.” It successfully spit out images when using “Chinese,” “Jewish” or “South African” prompts but refused to produce results for “white.” “I cannot fulfill your request due to the potential for perpetuating harmful stereotypes and biases associated with specific ethnicities or skin tones,” Gemini responded to the latter request.</p>
<p>“John L.,” who helped kickstart the backlash, <a class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://twitter.com/JohnLu0x/status/1760170103474356519">theorizes</a> that Google applied a well-intended but lazily tacked-on solution to a real problem. “Their system prompt to add diversity to portrayals of people isn’t very smart (it doesn’t account for gender in historically male roles like pope; doesn’t account for race in historical or national depictions),” the user posted. After the internet’s anti-“woke” brigade latched onto their posts, the user clarified that they support diverse representation but believe Google’s “stupid move” was that it failed to do so “in a nuanced way.”</p>
<p>Before pausing Gemini’s ability to produce people, Google wrote, “We’re working to improve these kinds of depictions immediately. Gemini’s Al image generation does generate a wide range of people. And that’s generally a good thing because people around the world use it. But it’s missing the mark here.”</p>
<p>The episode could be seen as a (much less subtle) callback to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-bard-ai-hands-on-a-work-in-progress-with-plenty-of-caveats-170956025.html">the launch of Bard in 2023</a>.

<p>As Google often does, it rebranded Bard in hopes of giving it a fresh start.

</div>


<p>Deep Sentinel&rsquo;s product and service offering was unique when I <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/583926/deep-sentinel-review.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reviewed the first-generation Deep Sentinel system</a> back in 2019. This camera-based home security system doesn&rsquo;t just document potential criminal activity, it can actively thwart it, thanks to live guards who monitor the cameras in real time. </p>



<p>Product offerings that pair Wi-Fi security cameras with round-the-clock professional monitoring have burgeoned since then, with leading camera brands like <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/2232378/security-camera-subscriptions-which-plans-offer-the-best-value.html">Ring, Arlo, Wyze, and others</a> putting their own spin on the concept.</p>



<p>After reviewing Deep Sentinel&rsquo;s second-generation system, Deep Sentinel DS2, I can say it&rsquo;s the most sophisticated, least-intrusive camera-based security system on the market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="how-does-the-deep-sentinel-ds2-system-work">How does the Deep Sentinel DS2 system work?</h2>



<p>The Deep Sentinel DS2 system usea artificial intelligence to monitor the activity outside your home. When movement is detected, the camera wakes up and begins recording video to a hub connected to your home network. AI analyzes the incoming video to distinguish potential threats, such as a prowler looking for a way into your home, and benign events like a car passing by or the neighbor&rsquo;s cat wandering into your yard.</p>


<div class="extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Deep Sentinel DS2" class="wp-image-2239278" height="800" src="https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Deep-Sentinel-DS2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" width="1200" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><p>DS2 hardware kits are available with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 cameras.</p> </figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Ansaldo/Foundry</p></div>



<p>If the system identifies a potential intruder on your property, a red LED ring around the face of the camera activates as a visual warning, and the hub begins streaming the camera&rsquo;s live video feed to Deep Sentinel&rsquo;s secure cloud. A guard at the company&rsquo;s monitoring center views the live video stream and determines if an intervention is warranted. </p>



<p>If it is, the guard can sound the camera&rsquo;s onboard siren and/or speak with the person via the camera&rsquo;s two-way audio. If those measures aren&rsquo;t sufficient to determine whether the person has a legitimate reason for being on your property or is a potential threat to your home&rsquo;s security and won&rsquo;t leave, the guard can notify both you and local law enforcement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="whats-included-with-a-deep-sentinel-ds2-system">What&rsquo;s included with a Deep Sentinel DS2 system?</h2>



<p>A Deep Sentinel DS2 kit includes between one and six security cameras, with mounting brackets and rechargeable batteries for each one; a single AI hub, and a lawn sign and window stickers that warn your property is protected by Deep Sentinel.</p>



<p>The second-generation cameras have been upgraded to record in 1920 x 1080 resolution (the originals downscaled to 480p resolution for transmission speed), and a small motion-activated spotlight has been added to to improve the camera&rsquo;s passive infrared night vision. The company also added an onboard USB port, so you can add a user-provided solar panel to keep the camera&rsquo;s battery topped off.</p>



<p>The AI processor inside the system&rsquo;s hub has also been improved.</p>



<p>Apart from those improvements, the cameras feature the same 130-degree field of view, a built-in speaker and microphone for two-way audio, a 102db onboard siren, and they&rsquo;re <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/578310/ip-ratings-explained.html">rated IP65 for protection from the elements</a>. That means they&rsquo;re impervious to dust ingress and that they can withstand water jets projected from any direction. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="is-the-deep-sentinel-ds2-system-easy-to-use">Is the Deep Sentinel DS2 system easy to use?</h2>



<p>The Deep Sentinel app does a good job of guiding you through the hub and camera setup. Once the camera(s) are paired with the hub, you&rsquo;ll take each one to the location you wish to monitor and verify its signal strength in the app before mounting it. It&rsquo;s also important that the cameras are positioned so that side-to-side traffic crosses their field of view, as their sensors are more sensitive to this type of motion and will respond more quickly.</p>



<p>Each camera mount requires just a single screw (provided); sliding the mount&rsquo;s arm up exposes its screw hole. The camera slides onto the mount and locks in place with a click. Once a camera is in place, the app will prompt you to set a &ldquo;protection zone&rdquo; of up to 30 feet by shaping a boundary box around the area you want the system&rsquo;s AI to monitor. Any activity detected in this area could alert Deep Sentinel agents, so you&rsquo;ll want to be judicious about coverage. If you&rsquo;re monitoring the walkway from your front door, for example, you&rsquo;ll want to be sure the protection zone doesn&rsquo;t extend down to the sidewalk, where any pedestrian could trigger the camera.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p class="imageCredit">Michael Ansaldo/Foundry</p></div>



<p>The final step is to test your connection with a Deep Sentinel guard. You&rsquo;ll stand in front of one of the cameras and make an &ldquo;A&rdquo; formation with your arms over your head. An agent will respond over the camera&rsquo;s speaker to confirm your system is up and running.</p>



<p>Once the system is activated, you can manage it using the app. The home tab is your main check-in point, displaying a carousel of recent video events, along with the name and badge number of the guard who reviewed each one and an icon denoting what action they took. A green checkmark indicates they verified everything was OK, while a yellow flag means they intervened. You can search all your recorded clips by event type, guard action, or camera location on the History tab.</p>



<p>Deep Sentinel&rsquo;s guards are polite and professional and mostly leave you to your business. That said, Deep Sentinel users have been known to get friendly with their guards, greeting them when they arrive home like another family member. No matter how gregarious you might be, however, there will be times when you <em>don&rsquo;t </em>want a third party seeing your camera feeds. With the Deep Sentinel system, you can make those feeds private at any time without turning them off. In this mode, the system will function more like a conventional Wi-Fi security camera, sending push notifications to your phone when warranted. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading toc" id="should-you-buy-a-deep-sentinel-ds2">Should you buy a Deep Sentinel DS2?</h2>



<p>Deep Sentinel DS2 offers better protection than any off-the-shelf Wi-Fi security camera I&rsquo;ve tested. Humans are still better equipped to contextualize and assess potential threats than the most advanced AI algorithm. And because human guards call law enforcement and verify active situations&mdash;providing suspect descriptions and details of suspicious behavior&mdash;they&rsquo;re taken more seriously. This should also eliminate false alarms. </p>



<p>On the other hand, this is also the most expensive security camera system I&rsquo;ve reviewed, especially if you&rsquo;re looking to monitor your home&rsquo;s entire perimeter. You&rsquo;ll probably need more than one camera. There&rsquo;s no coverage for the interior of your home, either; so, you&rsquo;ll probably also want a more conventional security system to protect you from an intruder who evades detection and breaks into your home. </p>



<p>All that said, the Deep Sentinel DS2 is the most sophisticated camera-based security system TechHive has tested, and it earns our strongest recommendation.</p>

Generative AI is the branch of AI that enables machines to learn patterns from vast datasets and then to autonomously produce new content based on those patterns. Although generative AI is fairly new, there are already many examples of models that can produce text, images, videos, and audio.</p><p>
	Many “<a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">foundation models</a>” have been trained on enough data to be competent in a wide variety of tasks. For example, a large language model can generate essays, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-programming" target="_blank">computer code</a>, recipes, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-protein-design" target="_blank">protein structures</a>, jokes, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chatgpt-medical-exam" target="_blank">medical diagnostic advice</a>, and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/" target="_blank">much more</a>. It can also theoretically generate instructions for building a bomb or creating a bioweapon, though safeguards are supposed to prevent such types of misuse.
</p><h2>What’s the difference between AI, machine learning, and generative AI?</h2><p>
	Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a wide variety of computational approaches to mimicking human intelligence. 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/can-machine-learning-teach-us-anything" target="_self">Machine learning</a> (ML) is a subset of AI; it focuses on algorithms that enable systems to learn from data and improve their performance. Before generative AI came along, most ML models learned from datasets to perform tasks such as classification or prediction. Generative AI is a specialized type of ML involving models that perform the task of generating new content, venturing into the realm of creativity.
</p><h2>What architectures do generative AI models use?</h2><p>
	Generative models are built using a variety of neural network architectures—essentially the design and structure that defines how the model is organized and how information flows through it. Some of the most well-known architectures are 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">variational autoencoders</a> (VAEs), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">generative adversarial networks</a> (GANs), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transformers</a>. It’s the transformer architecture, first shown in this seminal <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2017 paper from Google</a>, that powers today’s large language models. However, the transformer architecture is less suited for other types of generative AI, such as image and audio generation.</p><p>
	Autoencoders learn efficient representations of data through an 
	<a href="https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/543" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">encoder-decoder framework</a>. The encoder compresses input data into a lower-dimensional space, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_space" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latent (or embedding) space</a>, that preserves the most essential aspects of the data. A decoder can then use this compressed representation to reconstruct the original data. Once an autoencoder has been trained in this way, it can use novel inputs to generate what it considers the appropriate outputs. These models are often deployed in <a href="https://medium.com/@judyyes10/generate-images-using-variational-autoencoder-vae-4d429d9bdb5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">image-generation tools</a> and have also found use in <a href="https://keras.io/examples/generative/molecule_generation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drug discovery</a>, where they can be used to generate new molecules with desired properties.
</p><p>
	With generative adversarial networks (GANs), the training involves a 
	<a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/generator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">generator and a discriminator</a> that can be considered adversaries. The generator strives to create realistic data, while the discriminator aims to distinguish between those generated outputs and real “ground truth” outputs. Every time the discriminator catches a generated output, the generator uses that feedback to try to improve the quality of its outputs. But the discriminator also receives feedback on its performance. This adversarial interplay results in the refinement of both components, leading to the generation of increasingly authentic-seeming content. GANs are best known for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050923001916" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">creating deepfakes</a> but can also be used for more benign forms of image generation and many other applications.
</p><p>
	The transformer is arguably the reigning champion of generative AI architectures for its ubiquity in today’s powerful large language models (LLMs). Its strength lies in its attention mechanism, which enables the model to focus on different parts of an input sequence while making predictions. In the case of language models, the input consists of strings of words that make up sentences, and the transformer predicts what words will come next (we’ll get into the details below). In addition, transformers can process all the elements of a sequence in parallel rather than marching through it from beginning to end, as earlier types of models did; this 
	<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.15.0/parallelism" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">parallelization</a> makes training faster and more efficient. When developers added vast datasets of text for transformer models to learn from, today’s remarkable chatbots emerged.
</p><h2>How do large language models work?</h2><p>
	A transformer-based LLM is trained by giving it a vast dataset of text to learn from. The attention mechanism comes into play as it processes sentences and looks for patterns. By looking at all the words in a sentence at once, it gradually begins to understand which words are most commonly found together and which words are most important to the meaning of the sentence. It learns these things by trying to predict the next word in a sentence and comparing its guess to the ground truth. Its errors act as feedback signals that cause the model to adjust the weights it assigns to various words before it tries again.

<img alt="A chart shows the size of five LLMs in parameters and their performance on a benchmark." class="rm-shortcode rm-resized-image" id="91ba0" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-chart-shows-the-size-of-five-llms-in-parameters-and-their-performance-on-a-benchmark.png?id=51455578&amp;width=980" />
<small class="image-media media-caption">These five LLMs vary greatly in size (given in parameters), and the larger models have better performance on a standard LLM benchmark test. </small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit">IEEE Spectrum</small>
</p><p>
	To explain the training process in slightly more technical terms, the text in the training data is broken down into elements called 
	<a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/05/what-is-tokenization-nlp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tokens</a>, which are words or pieces of words—but for simplicity’s sake, let’s say all tokens are words. As the model goes through the sentences in its training data and learns the relationships between tokens, it creates a list of numbers, called a vector, for each one. All the numbers in the vector represent various aspects of the word: its semantic meanings, its relationship to other words, its frequency of use, and so on. Similar words, like <em>elegant </em>and <em>fancy</em>, will have similar vectors and will also be near each other in the vector space. These vectors are called word embeddings. The parameters of an LLM include the weights associated with all the word embeddings and the attention mechanism. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gpt-4" target="_blank">GPT-4</a>, the OpenAI model that’s considered the current champion, is rumored to have more than 1 trillion parameters. </p><p>
	Given enough data and training time, the LLM begins to understand the subtleties of language. While much of the training involves looking at text sentence by sentence, the attention mechanism also captures relationships between words throughout a longer text sequence of many paragraphs. Once an LLM is trained and is ready for use, the attention mechanism is still in play. When the model is generating text in response to a prompt, it’s using its predictive powers to decide what the next word should be. When generating longer pieces of text, it predicts the next word in the context of all the words it has written so far; this function increases the coherence and continuity of its writing.
</p><h2>Why do large language models hallucinate?</h2><p>
	You may have heard that LLMs sometimes “<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-hallucination" target="_self">hallucinate</a>.” That’s a polite way to say they make stuff up very convincingly. A model sometimes generates text that fits the context and is grammatically correct, yet the material is erroneous or nonsensical. This bad habit stems from LLMs training on vast troves of data drawn from the Internet, plenty of which is not factually accurate. Since the model is simply trying to predict the next word in a sequence based on what it has seen, it may generate plausible-sounding text that has no grounding in reality.
</p><h2>Why is generative AI controversial?</h2><p>
	One source of controversy for generative AI is the provenance of its training data. Most AI companies that train large models to generate text, images, video, and audio have 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-ethics" target="_self">not been transparent</a> about the content of their training datasets. Various leaks and experiments have revealed that those datasets <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/midjourney-copyright" target="_self">include copyrighted material</a> such as books, newspaper articles, and movies. A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/artists-take-new-shot-stability-midjourney-updated-copyright-lawsuit-2023-11-30" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">number</a> of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/john-grisham-other-top-us-authors-sue-openai-over-copyrights-2023-09-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lawsuits</a> are underway to determine whether <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/generative-ai-ip-problem" target="_self">use of copyrighted material</a> for training AI systems constitutes fair use, or whether the AI companies need to pay the copyright holders for use of their material.
</p><p>
	On a related note, many people are concerned that the widespread use of generative AI <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-taking-over-jobs" target="_blank">will take jobs away</a> from creative humans who make art, music, written works, and so forth. People are also concerned that it could take jobs from humans who do a wide range of white-collar jobs, including translators, paralegals, customer-service representatives, and journalists. There have already been a few 
	<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/10/duolingo-ai-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">troubling layoffs</a>, but it’s hard to say yet whether generative AI will be reliable enough for large-scale enterprise applications. (See above about hallucinations.)</p><p>
	Finally, there’s the danger that generative AI will be used to make bad stuff. And there are of course many categories of bad stuff it could theoretically be used for. Generative AI can be used for personalized scams and phishing attacks: For example, using “voice cloning,” scammers can 
	<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scammers-ai-mimic-voices-loved-ones-in-distress/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">copy the voice of a specific person</a> and call the person’s family with a plea for help (and money). All formats of generative AI—text, audio, image, and video—can be used to generate misinformation by creating plausible-seeming representations of things that never happened, which is a particularly worrying possibility when it comes to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/deepfakes-election" target="_self">elections</a>. (Meanwhile, as <em>IEEE </em><em>Spectrum</em> reported this week, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission has responded by <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-robocalls-2667266649" target="_blank">outlawing AI-generated robocalls</a>.) Image- and video-generating tools can be used to produce nonconsensual pornography, although the tools made by mainstream companies disallow such use. And chatbots can theoretically walk a would-be terrorist through the steps of making a bomb, nerve gas, and a host of other horrors. Although the big LLMs have safeguards to prevent such misuse, some hackers delight in circumventing those safeguards. What’s more, “uncensored” versions of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-source-ai-2666932122" target="_self">open-source LLMs</a> are out there.
</p><p>
	Despite such potential problems, many people think that generative AI can also make people more productive and could be used as a tool to enable entirely new forms of creativity. We’ll likely see both disasters and creative flowerings and plenty else that we don’t expect. But knowing the basics of how these models work is increasingly crucial for tech-savvy people today. Because no matter how sophisticated these systems grow, it’s the humans’ job to keep them running, make the next ones better, and with any luck, help people out too.

<p><strong>Dina Genkina:</strong> Hi. I’m <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/dina_genkina" target="_self">Dina Genkina</a> for <em>IEEE Spectrum</em>‘s <em>Fixing the Future</em>. Before we start, I want to tell you that you can get the latest coverage from some of Spectrum’s most important beeps, including AI, Change, and Robotics, by signing up for one of our free newsletters. Just go to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/newsletters/" target="_self">spectrum.ieee.org\newsletters</a> to subscribe. Today, a guest is Dr. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benji-maruyama-563b57b8/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Benji Maruyama,</a> a Principal Materials Research Engineer at the <a href="https://www.afrl.af.mil/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Air Force Research Laboratory</a>, or AFRL. Dr. Maruyama is a materials scientist, and his research focuses on carbon nanotubes and making research go faster. But he’s also a man with a dream, a dream of a world where science isn’t something done by a select few locked away in an ivory tower, but something most people can participate in. He hopes to start what he calls the billion scientist movement by building AI-enabled research robots that are accessible to all. Benji, thank you for coming on the show.</p><p>Benji Maruyama: Thanks, Dina. Great to be with you. I appreciate the invitation.</p><p>Genkina: Yeah. So let’s set the scene a little bit for our listeners. So you advocate for this billion scientist movement. If everything works amazingly, what would this look like? Paint us a picture of how AI will help us get there.</p><p>Maruyama: Right, great. Thanks. Yeah. So one of the things as you set the scene there is right now, to be a scientist, most people need to have access to a big lab with very expensive equipment. So I think top universities, government labs, industry folks, lots of equipment. It’s like a million dollars, right, to get one of them. And frankly, just not that many of us have access to those kinds of instruments. But at the same time, there’s probably a lot of us who want to do science, right? And so how do we make it so that anyone who wants to do science can try, can have access to instruments so that they can contribute to it. So that’s the basics behind citizen science or democratization of science so that everyone can do it. And one way to think of it is what happened with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/3d-printing" target="_self">3D printing</a>. It used to be that in order to make something, you had to have access to a machine shop or maybe get fancy tools and dyes that could cost tens of thousands of dollars a pop. Or if you wanted to do electronics, you had to have access to very expensive equipment or services. But when 3D printers came along and became very inexpensive, all of a sudden now, anyone with access to a 3D printer, so maybe in a school or a library or a makerspace could print something out. And it could be something fun, like a game piece, but it could also be something that got you to an invention, something that was maybe useful to the community, was either a prototype or an actual working device.</p><p>And so really, 3D printing democratized manufacturing, right? It made it so that many more of us could do things that before only a select few could. And so that’s where we’re trying to go with science now, is that instead of only those of us who have access to big labs, we’re building research robots. And when I say we, we’re doing it, but now there are a lot of others who are doing it as well, and I’ll get into that. But the example that we have is that we took a 3D printer that you can buy off the internet for less than $300. Plus a couple of extra parts, a webcam, a Raspberry Pi board, and a tripod really, so only four components. You can get them all for $300. Load them with open-source software that was developed by AFIT, the <a href="https://www.afit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Air Force Institute of Technology</a>. So <a href="https://www.afit.edu/BIOS/bio.cfm?facID=172" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Burt Peterson</a> and Greg Captain [inaudible]. We worked together to build this fully autonomous 3D printing robot that taught itself how to print to better than manufacturer’s specifications. So that was a really fun advance for us, and now we’re trying to take that same idea and broaden it. So I’ll turn it back over to you.</p><p>Genkina: Yeah, okay. So maybe let’s talk a little bit about this automated research robot that you’ve made. So right now, it works with a 3D printer, but is the big picture that one day it’s going to give people access to that million dollar lab? How would that look like?</p><p>Maruyama: Right, so there are different models out there. One, we just did a workshop at the University of— sorry, North Carolina State University about that very problem, right? So there’s two models. One is to get low-cost scientific tools like the 3D printer. There’s a couple of different chemistry robots, one out of University of Maryland and NIST, one out of University of Washington that are in the sort of 300 to 1,000 dollars range that makes it accessible. The other part is kind of the user facility model. So in the US, the Department of Energy National Labs have many user facilities where you can apply to get time on very expensive instruments. Now we’re talking tens of millions. For example, Brookhaven has a synchrotron light source where you can sign up and it doesn’t cost you any money to use the facility. And you can get days on that facility. And so that’s already there, but now the advances are that by using this, autonomy, autonomous closed loop experimentation, that the work that you do will be much faster and much more productive. So, for example, on ARES, our Autonomous Research System at AFRL, we actually were able to do experiments so fast that a professor who came into my lab said, it just took me aside and said, “Hey, Benji, in a week’s worth of time, I did a dissertation’s worth of research.” So maybe five years worth of research in a week. So imagine if you keep doing that week after week after week, how fast research goes. So it’s very exciting.</p><p>Genkina: Yeah, so tell us a little bit about how that works. So what’s this system that has sped up five years of research into a week and made graduate students obsolete? Not yet, not yet. How does that work? Is that the 3D printer system or is that a—</p><p>Maruyama: So we started with our system to grow carbon nanotubes. And I’ll say, actually, when we first thought about it, your comment about graduate students being absolute— obsolete, sorry, is interesting and important because, when we first built our system that worked it 100 times faster than normal, I thought that might be the case. We called it sort of graduate student out of the loop. But when I started talking with people who specialize in autonomy, it’s actually the opposite, right? It’s actually empowering graduate students to go faster and also to do the work that they want to do, right? And so just to digress a little bit, if you think about farmers before the Industrial Revolution, what were they doing? They were plowing fields with oxen and beasts of burden and hand plows. And it was hard work. And now, of course, you wouldn’t ask a farmer today to give up their tractor or their combine harvester, right? They would say, of course not. So very soon, we expect it to be the same for researchers, that if you asked a graduate student to give up their autonomous research robot five years from now, they’ll say, “Are you crazy? This is how I get my work done.”</p><p>But for our original ARES system, it worked on the synthesis of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/carbon-nanotubes" target="_self">carbon nanotubes</a>. So that meant that what we’re doing is trying to take this system that’s been pretty well studied, but we haven’t figured out how to make it at scale. So at hundreds of millions of tons per year, sort of like polyethylene production. And part of that is because it’s slow, right? One experiment takes a day, but also because there are just so many different ways to do a reaction, so many different combinations of temperature and pressure and a dozen different gases and half the periodic table as far as the catalyst. It’s just too much to just brute force your way through. So even though we went from experiments where we could do 100 experiments a day instead of one experiment a day, just that combinatorial space was vastly overwhelmed our ability to do it, even with many research robots or many graduate students. So the idea of having artificial intelligence algorithms that drive the research is key. And so that ability to do an experiment, see what happened, and then analyze it, iterate, and constantly be able to choose the optimal next best experiment to do is where ARES really shines. And so that’s what we did. ARES taught itself how to grow carbon nanotubes at controlled rates. And we were the first ones to do that for material science in our 2016 publication.</p><p>Genkina: That’s very exciting. So maybe we can peer under the hood a little bit of this AI model. How does the magic work? How does it pick the next best point to take and why it’s better than you could do as a graduate student or researcher?</p><p>Maruyama: Yeah, and so I think it’s interesting, right? In science, a lot of times we’re taught to hold everything constant, change one variable at a time, search over that entire space, see what happened, and then go back and try something else, right? So we reduce it to one variable at a time. It’s a reductionist approach. And that’s worked really well, but a lot of the problems that we want to go after are simply too complex for that reductionist approach. And so the benefit of being able to use artificial intelligence is that high dimensionality is no problem, right? Tens of dimensions search over very complex high-dimensional parameter space, which is overwhelming to humans, right? Is just basically bread and butter for AI. The other part to it is the iterative part. The beauty of doing autonomous experimentation is that you’re constantly iterating. You’re constantly learning over what just happened. You might also say, well, not only do I know what happened experimentally, but I have other sources of prior knowledge, right? So for example, ideal gas law says that this should happen, right? Or Gibbs phase rule might say, this can happen or this can’t happen. So you can use that prior knowledge to say, “Okay, I’m not going to do those experiments because that’s not going to work. I’m going to try here because this has the best chance of working.”</p><p>And within that, there are many different machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms. Bayesian optimization is a popular one to help you choose what experiment is best. There’s also new AI that people are trying to develop to get better search.</p><p>Genkina: Cool. And so the software part of this autonomous robot is available for anyone to download, which is also really exciting. So what would someone need to do to be able to use that? Do they need to get a 3D printer and a Raspberry Pi and set it up? And what would they be able to do with it? Can they just build carbon nanotubes or can they do more stuff?</p><p>Maruyama: Right. So what we did, we built ARES OS, which is our open source software, and we’ll make sure to get you <a href="https://github.com/AFRL-ARES/ARES_OS" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the GitHub link</a> so that anyone can download it. And the idea behind ARES OS is that it provides a software framework for anyone to build their own autonomous research robot. And so the 3D printing example will be out there soon. But it’s the starting point. Of course, if you want to build your own new kind of robot, you still have to do the software development, for example, to link the ARES framework, the core, if you will, to your particular hardware, maybe your particular camera or 3D printer, or pipetting robot, or spectrometer, whatever that is. We have examples out there and we’re hoping to get to a point where it becomes much more user-friendly. So having direct Python connects so that you don’t— currently it’s programmed in C#. But to make it more accessible, we’d like it to be set up so that if you can do Python, you can probably have good success in building your own research robot.</p><p>Genkina: Cool. And you’re also working on a educational version of this, I understand. So what’s the status of that and what’s different about that version?</p><p>Maruyama: Yeah, right. So the educational version is going to be-- its sort of composition of a combination of hardware and software. So what we’re starting with is a low-cost 3D printer. And we’re collaborating now with the <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/materials-design-innovation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University at Buffalo, Materials Design Innovation Department</a>. And we’re hoping to build up a robot based on a 3D printer. And we’ll see how it goes. It’s still evolving. But for example, it could be based on this very inexpensive $200 3D printer. It’s an <a href="https://store.creality.com/collections/ender-series-3d-printer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ender 3D printer</a>. There’s another printer out there that’s based on <a href="https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Main_Page" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Washington’s Jubilee printer</a>. And that’s a very exciting development as well. So professors <a href="https://mse.washington.edu/facultyfinder/lilo-pozzo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lilo Pozzo</a> and <a href="https://www.hcde.washington.edu/peek" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nadya Peek</a> at the University of Washington built this Jubilee robot with that idea of accessibility in mind. And so combining our ARES OS software with their Jubilee robot hardware is something that I’m very excited about and hope to be able to move forward on.</p><p>Genkina: What’s this Jubilee 3D printer? How is it different from a regular 3D printer?</p><p>Maruyama: It’s very open source. Not all 3D printers are open source and it’s based on a gantry system with interchangeable heads. So for example, you can get not just a 3D printing head, but other heads that might do things like do indentation, see how stiff something is, or maybe put a camera on there that can move around. And so it’s the flexibility of being able to pick different heads dynamically that I think makes it super useful. For the software, right, we have to have a good, accessible, user-friendly graphical user interface, a GUI. That takes time and effort, so we want to work on that. But again, that’s just the hardware software. Really to make ARES a good educational platform, we need to make it so that a teacher who’s interested can have the lowest activation barrier possible, right? We want she or he to be able to pull a lesson plan off of the internet, have supporting YouTube videos, and actually have the material that is a fully developed curriculum that’s mapped against state standards.</p><p>So that, right now, if you’re a teacher who— let’s face it, teachers are already overwhelmed with all that they have to do, putting something like this into their curriculum can be a lot of work, especially if you have to think about, well, I’m going to take all this time, but I also have to meet all of my teaching standards, all the state curriculum standards. And so if we build that out so that it’s a matter of just looking at the curriculum and just checking off the boxes of what state standards it maps to, then that makes it that much easier for the teacher to teach.</p><p>Genkina: Great. And what do you think is the timeline? Do you expect to be able to do this sometime in the coming year?</p><p>Maruyama: That’s right. These things always take longer than hoped for than expected, but we’re hoping to do it within this calendar year and very excited to get it going. And I would say for your listeners, if you’re interested in working together, please let me know. We’re very excited about trying to involve as many people as we can.</p><p>Genkina: Great. Okay, so you have the educational version, and you have the more research geared version, and you’re working on making this educational version more accessible. Is there something with the research version that you’re working on next, how you’re hoping to upgrade it, or is there something you’re using it for right now that you’re excited about?</p><p>There’s a number of things that we are very excited about the possibility of carbon nanotubes being produced at very large scale. So right now, people may remember carbon nanotubes as that great material that sort of never made it and was very overhyped. But there’s a core group of us who are still working on it because of the important promise of that material. So it’s material that is super strong, stiff, lightweight, electrically conductive. Much better than silicon as a digital electronics compute material. All of those great things, except we’re not making it at large enough scale. It’s actually used pretty significantly in lithium-ion batteries. It’s an important application. But other than that, it’s sort of like where’s my flying car? It’s never panned out. But there’s, as I said, a group of us who are working to really produce carbon nanotubes at much larger scale. So large scale for nanotubes now is sort of in the kilogram or ton scale. But what we need to get to is hundreds of millions of tons per year production rates. And why is that? Well, there’s a great effort that came out of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/Arpa-e" target="_self">ARPA-E</a>. So the Department of Energy Advanced Research Projects Agency and the E is for Energy in that case.</p><p>So they funded a collaboration between Shell Oil and Rice University to pyrolyze methane, so natural gas into hydrogen for the hydrogen economy. So now that’s a clean burning fuel plus carbon. And instead of burning the carbon to CO2, which is what we now do, right? We just take natural gas and feed it through a turbine and generate electric power instead of— and that, by the way, generates so much CO2 that it’s causing global climate change. So if we can do that pyrolysis at scale, at hundreds of millions of tons per year, it’s literally a save the world proposition, meaning that we can avoid so much CO2 emissions that we can reduce global CO2 emissions by 20 to 40 percent. And that is the save the world proposition. It’s a huge undertaking, right? That’s a big problem to tackle, starting with the science. We still don’t have the science to efficiently and effectively make carbon nanotubes at that scale. And then, of course, we have to take the material and turn it into useful products. So the batteries is the first example, but thinking about replacing copper for electrical wire, replacing steel for structural materials, aluminum, all those kinds of applications. But we can’t do it. We can’t even get to that kind of development because we haven’t been able to make the carbon nanotubes at sufficient scale.</p><p>So I would say that’s something that I’m working on now that I’m very excited about and trying to get there, but it’s going to take some good developments in our research robots and some very smart people to get us there.</p><p>Genkina: Yeah, it seems so counterintuitive that making everything out of carbon is good for lowering carbon emissions, but I guess that’s the break.</p><p>Maruyama: Yeah, it is interesting, right? So people talk about carbon emissions, but really, the molecule that’s causing global warming is carbon dioxide, CO2, which you get from burning carbon. And so if you take that methane and parallelize it to carbon nanotubes, that carbon is now sequestered, right? It’s not going off as CO2. It’s staying in solid state. And not only is it just not going up into the atmosphere, but now we’re using it to replace steel, for example, which, by the way, steel, aluminum, copper production, all of those things emit lots of CO2 in their production, right? They’re energy intensive as a material production. So it’s kind of ironic.</p><p>Genkina: Okay, and are there any other research robots that you’re excited about that you think are also contributing to this democratization of science process?</p><p>Maruyama: Yeah, so we talked about Jubilee, the NIST robot, which is from Professor Ichiro Takeuchi at Maryland and Gilad Kusne at NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology. Theirs is fun too. It’s LEGO as. So it’s actually based on a LEGO robotics platform. So it’s an actual chemistry robot built out of Legos. So I think that’s fun as well. And you can imagine, just like we have LEGO robot competitions, we can have autonomous research robot competitions where we try and do research through these robots or competitions where everybody sort of starts with the same robot, just like with LEGO robotics. So that’s fun as well. But I would say there’s a growing number of people doing these kinds of, first of all, low-cost science, accessible science, but in particular low-cost autonomous experimentation.</p><p>Genkina: So how far are we from a world where a high school student has an idea and they can just go and carry it out on some autonomous research system at some high-end lab?</p><p>Maruyama: That’s a really good question. I hope that it’s going to be in 5 to 10 years, that it becomes reasonably commonplace. But it’s going to take still some significant investment to get this going. And so we’ll see how that goes. But I don’t think there are any scientific impediments to getting this done. There is a significant amount of engineering to be done. And sometimes we hear, oh, it’s just engineering. The engineering is a significant problem. And it’s work to get some of these things accessible, low cost. But there are lots of great efforts. There are people who have used CDs, compact discs to make spectrometers out of. There are lots of good examples of citizen science out there. But it’s, I think, at this point, going to take investment in software, in hardware to make it accessible, and then importantly, getting students really up to speed on what AI is and how it works and how it can help them. And so I think it’s actually really important. So again, that’s the democratization of science is if we can make it available to everyone and accessible, then that helps people, everyone contribute to science. And I do believe that there are important contributions to be made by ordinary citizens, by people who aren’t you know PhDs working in a lab.</p><p>And I think there’s a lot of science out there to be done. If you ask working scientists, almost no one has run out of ideas or things they want to work on. There’s many more scientific problems to work on than we have the time where people are funding to work on. And so if we make science cheaper to do, then all of a sudden, more people can do science. And so those questions start to be resolved. And so I think that’s super important. And now we have, instead of, just those of us who work in big labs, you have millions, tens of millions, up to a billion people, that’s the billion scientist idea, who are contributing to the scientific community. And that, to me, is so powerful that many more of us can contribute than just the few of us who do it right now.</p><p>Genkina: Okay, that’s a great place to end on, I think. So, today we spoke to Dr. Benji Maruyama, a material scientist at AFRL, about his efforts to democratize scientific discovery through automated research robots. For IEEE Spectrum, I’m Dina Genkina, and I hope you’ll join us next time on Fixing the Future.</p></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

Generative AI is the branch of AI that enables machines to learn patterns from vast datasets and then to autonomously produce new content based on those patterns. Although generative AI is fairly new, there are already many examples of models that can produce text, images, videos, and audio.</p><p>
	Many “<a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">foundation models</a>” have been trained on enough data to be competent in a wide variety of tasks. For example, a large language model can generate essays, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-programming" target="_blank">computer code</a>, recipes, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-protein-design" target="_blank">protein structures</a>, jokes, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chatgpt-medical-exam" target="_blank">medical diagnostic advice</a>, and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-large-language-models-used-for/" target="_blank">much more</a>. It can also theoretically generate instructions for building a bomb or creating a bioweapon, though safeguards are supposed to prevent such types of misuse.
</p><h2>What’s the difference between AI, machine learning, and generative AI?</h2><p>
	Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a wide variety of computational approaches to mimicking human intelligence. 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/can-machine-learning-teach-us-anything" target="_self">Machine learning</a> (ML) is a subset of AI; it focuses on algorithms that enable systems to learn from data and improve their performance. Before generative AI came along, most ML models learned from datasets to perform tasks such as classification or prediction. Generative AI is a specialized type of ML involving models that perform the task of generating new content, venturing into the realm of creativity.
</p><h2>What architectures do generative AI models use?</h2><p>
	Generative models are built using a variety of neural network architectures—essentially the design and structure that defines how the model is organized and how information flows through it. Some of the most well-known architectures are 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">variational autoencoders</a> (VAEs), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">generative adversarial networks</a> (GANs), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transformers</a>. It’s the transformer architecture, first shown in this seminal <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2017 paper from Google</a>, that powers today’s large language models. However, the transformer architecture is less suited for other types of generative AI, such as image and audio generation.</p><p>
	Autoencoders learn efficient representations of data through an 
	<a href="https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/543" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">encoder-decoder framework</a>. The encoder compresses input data into a lower-dimensional space, known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_space" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latent (or embedding) space</a>, that preserves the most essential aspects of the data. A decoder can then use this compressed representation to reconstruct the original data. Once an autoencoder has been trained in this way, it can use novel inputs to generate what it considers the appropriate outputs. These models are often deployed in <a href="https://medium.com/@judyyes10/generate-images-using-variational-autoencoder-vae-4d429d9bdb5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">image-generation tools</a> and have also found use in <a href="https://keras.io/examples/generative/molecule_generation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">drug discovery</a>, where they can be used to generate new molecules with desired properties.
</p><p>
	With generative adversarial networks (GANs), the training involves a 
	<a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan/generator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">generator and a discriminator</a> that can be considered adversaries. The generator strives to create realistic data, while the discriminator aims to distinguish between those generated outputs and real “ground truth” outputs. Every time the discriminator catches a generated output, the generator uses that feedback to try to improve the quality of its outputs. But the discriminator also receives feedback on its performance. This adversarial interplay results in the refinement of both components, leading to the generation of increasingly authentic-seeming content. GANs are best known for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050923001916" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">creating deepfakes</a> but can also be used for more benign forms of image generation and many other applications.
</p><p>
	The transformer is arguably the reigning champion of generative AI architectures for its ubiquity in today’s powerful large language models (LLMs). Its strength lies in its attention mechanism, which enables the model to focus on different parts of an input sequence while making predictions. In the case of language models, the input consists of strings of words that make up sentences, and the transformer predicts what words will come next (we’ll get into the details below). In addition, transformers can process all the elements of a sequence in parallel rather than marching through it from beginning to end, as earlier types of models did; this 
	<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.15.0/parallelism" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">parallelization</a> makes training faster and more efficient. When developers added vast datasets of text for transformer models to learn from, today’s remarkable chatbots emerged.
</p><h2>How do large language models work?</h2><p>
	A transformer-based LLM is trained by giving it a vast dataset of text to learn from. The attention mechanism comes into play as it processes sentences and looks for patterns. By looking at all the words in a sentence at once, it gradually begins to understand which words are most commonly found together and which words are most important to the meaning of the sentence. It learns these things by trying to predict the next word in a sentence and comparing its guess to the ground truth. Its errors act as feedback signals that cause the model to adjust the weights it assigns to various words before it tries again.

<small class="image-media media-caption">These five LLMs vary greatly in size (given in parameters), and the larger models have better performance on a standard LLM benchmark test. </small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit">IEEE Spectrum</small>
</p><p>
	To explain the training process in slightly more technical terms, the text in the training data is broken down into elements called 
	<a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/05/what-is-tokenization-nlp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tokens</a>, which are words or pieces of words—but for simplicity’s sake, let’s say all tokens are words. As the model goes through the sentences in its training data and learns the relationships between tokens, it creates a list of numbers, called a vector, for each one. All the numbers in the vector represent various aspects of the word: its semantic meanings, its relationship to other words, its frequency of use, and so on. Similar words, like <em>elegant </em>and <em>fancy</em>, will have similar vectors and will also be near each other in the vector space. These vectors are called word embeddings. The parameters of an LLM include the weights associated with all the word embeddings and the attention mechanism. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gpt-4" target="_blank">GPT-4</a>, the OpenAI model that’s considered the current champion, is rumored to have more than 1 trillion parameters. </p><p>
	Given enough data and training time, the LLM begins to understand the subtleties of language. While much of the training involves looking at text sentence by sentence, the attention mechanism also captures relationships between words throughout a longer text sequence of many paragraphs. Once an LLM is trained and is ready for use, the attention mechanism is still in play. When the model is generating text in response to a prompt, it’s using its predictive powers to decide what the next word should be. When generating longer pieces of text, it predicts the next word in the context of all the words it has written so far; this function increases the coherence and continuity of its writing.
</p><h2>Why do large language models hallucinate?</h2><p>
	You may have heard that LLMs sometimes “<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-hallucination" target="_self">hallucinate</a>.” That’s a polite way to say they make stuff up very convincingly. A model sometimes generates text that fits the context and is grammatically correct, yet the material is erroneous or nonsensical. This bad habit stems from LLMs training on vast troves of data drawn from the Internet, plenty of which is not factually accurate. Since the model is simply trying to predict the next word in a sequence based on what it has seen, it may generate plausible-sounding text that has no grounding in reality.
</p><h2>Why is generative AI controversial?</h2><p>
	One source of controversy for generative AI is the provenance of its training data. Most AI companies that train large models to generate text, images, video, and audio have 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-ethics" target="_self">not been transparent</a> about the content of their training datasets. Various leaks and experiments have revealed that those datasets <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/midjourney-copyright" target="_self">include copyrighted material</a> such as books, newspaper articles, and movies. A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/artists-take-new-shot-stability-midjourney-updated-copyright-lawsuit-2023-11-30" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">number</a> of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/john-grisham-other-top-us-authors-sue-openai-over-copyrights-2023-09-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lawsuits</a> are underway to determine whether <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/generative-ai-ip-problem" target="_self">use of copyrighted material</a> for training AI systems constitutes fair use, or whether the AI companies need to pay the copyright holders for use of their material.
</p><p>
	On a related note, many people are concerned that the widespread use of generative AI <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-taking-over-jobs" target="_blank">will take jobs away</a> from creative humans who make art, music, written works, and so forth. People are also concerned that it could take jobs from humans who do a wide range of white-collar jobs, including translators, paralegals, customer-service representatives, and journalists. There have already been a few 
	<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/10/duolingo-ai-layoffs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">troubling layoffs</a>, but it’s hard to say yet whether generative AI will be reliable enough for large-scale enterprise applications. (See above about hallucinations.)</p><p>
	Finally, there’s the danger that generative AI will be used to make bad stuff. And there are of course many categories of bad stuff it could theoretically be used for. Generative AI can be used for personalized scams and phishing attacks: For example, using “voice cloning,” scammers can 
	<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scammers-ai-mimic-voices-loved-ones-in-distress/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">copy the voice of a specific person</a> and call the person’s family with a plea for help (and money). All formats of generative AI—text, audio, image, and video—can be used to generate misinformation by creating plausible-seeming representations of things that never happened, which is a particularly worrying possibility when it comes to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/deepfakes-election" target="_self">elections</a>. (Meanwhile, as <em>IEEE </em><em>Spectrum</em> reported this week, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission has responded by <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-robocalls-2667266649" target="_blank">outlawing AI-generated robocalls</a>.) Image- and video-generating tools can be used to produce nonconsensual pornography, although the tools made by mainstream companies disallow such use. And chatbots can theoretically walk a would-be terrorist through the steps of making a bomb, nerve gas, and a host of other horrors. Although the big LLMs have safeguards to prevent such misuse, some hackers delight in circumventing those safeguards. What’s more, “uncensored” versions of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-source-ai-2666932122" target="_self">open-source LLMs</a> are out there.
</p><p>
	Despite such potential problems, many people think that generative AI can also make people more productive and could be used as a tool to enable entirely new forms of creativity. We’ll likely see both disasters and creative flowerings and plenty else that we don’t expect. But knowing the basics of how these models work is increasingly crucial for tech-savvy people today. Because no matter how sophisticated these systems grow, it’s the humans’ job to keep them running, make the next ones better, and with any luck, help people out too.

We train our neural network to pick up all kinds of objects—both rigid and deformable and transparent things. Because we train manipulation end-to-end from pixels, picking up deformables and transparent objects is much easier than a classical grasping pipeline, where you have to figure out the exact geometry of what you are trying to grasp.</p><p><strong>What keeps your robots from doing these tasks faster?</strong></p><p><strong>Jang: </strong>Our robots learn from demonstrations, so they go at exactly the same speed the human teleoperators demonstrate the task at.

</ul><p>
<a name="big"></a><strong>The great advances in deep learning over the past decade or so have been powered by ever-bigger models crunching ever-bigger amounts of data. Some people argue that that’s an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-learning-computational-cost" target="_self">unsustainable trajectory</a>. Do you agree that it can’t go on that way?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Andrew Ng: </strong>This is a big question. We’ve seen foundation models in NLP [natural language processing]. I’m excited about NLP models getting even bigger, and also about the potential of building foundation models in computer vision. I think there’s lots of signal to still be exploited in video: We have not been able to build foundation models yet for video because of compute bandwidth and the cost of processing video, as opposed to tokenized text. So I think that this engine of scaling up deep learning algorithms, which has been running for something like 15 years now, still has steam in it. Having said that, it only applies to certain problems, and there’s a set of other problems that need small data solutions.
</p><p>
<strong>When you say you want a foundation model for computer vision, what do you mean by that?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> This is a term coined by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Percy Liang</a> and <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">some of my friends at Stanford</a> to refer to very large models, trained on very large data sets, that can be tuned for specific applications. For example, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-ais-powerful-text-generating-tool-is-ready-for-business" target="_self">GPT-3</a> is an example of a foundation model [for NLP]. Foundation models offer a lot of promise as a new paradigm in developing machine learning applications, but also challenges in terms of making sure that they’re reasonably fair and free from bias, especially if many of us will be building on top of them.
</p><p>
<strong>What needs to happen for someone to build a foundation model for video?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> I think there is a scalability problem. The compute power needed to process the large volume of images for video is significant, and I think that’s why foundation models have arisen first in NLP. Many researchers are working on this, and I think we’re seeing early signs of such models being developed in computer vision. But I’m confident that if a semiconductor maker gave us 10 times more processor power, we could easily find 10 times more video to build such models for vision.
</p><p>
	Having said that, a lot of what’s happened over the past decade is that deep learning has happened in consumer-facing companies that have large user bases, sometimes billions of users, and therefore very large data sets. While that paradigm of machine learning has driven a lot of economic value in consumer software, I find that that recipe of scale doesn’t work for other industries.
</p><p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><a name="career"></a>
</p><p>
<strong>It’s funny to hear you say that, because your early work was at a consumer-facing company with millions of users.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Over a decade ago, when I proposed starting the <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Brain</a> project to use Google’s compute infrastructure to build very large neural networks, it was a controversial step. One very senior person pulled me aside and warned me that starting Google Brain would be bad for my career. I think he felt that the action couldn’t just be in scaling up, and that I should instead focus on architecture innovation.
</p><p class="pull-quote">
	“In many industries where giant data sets simply don’t exist, I think the focus has to shift from big data to good data. Having 50 thoughtfully engineered examples can be sufficient to explain to the neural network what you want it to learn.”<br />
	—Andrew Ng, CEO & Founder, Landing AI
</p><p>
	I remember when my students and I published the first 
	<a href="https://nips.cc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NeurIPS</a> workshop paper advocating using <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CUDA</a>, a platform for processing on GPUs, for deep learning—a different senior person in AI sat me down and said, “CUDA is really complicated to program. As a programming paradigm, this seems like too much work.” I did manage to convince him; the other person I did not convince.
</p><p>
<strong>I expect they’re both convinced now.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> I think so, yes.
</p><p>
	Over the past year as I’ve been speaking to people about the data-centric AI movement, I’ve been getting flashbacks to when I was speaking to people about deep learning and scalability 10 or 15 years ago. In the past year, I’ve been getting the same mix of “there’s nothing new here” and “this seems like the wrong direction.”
</p><p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><a name="defining"></a>
</p><p>
<strong>How do you define data-centric AI, and why do you consider it a movement?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> Data-centric AI is the discipline of systematically engineering the data needed to successfully build an AI system. For an AI system, you have to implement some algorithm, say a neural network, in code and then train it on your data set. The dominant paradigm over the last decade was to download the data set while you focus on improving the code. Thanks to that paradigm, over the last decade deep learning networks have improved significantly, to the point where for a lot of applications the code—the neural network architecture—is basically a solved problem. So for many practical applications, it’s now more productive to hold the neural network architecture fixed, and instead find ways to improve the data.
</p><p>
	When I started speaking about this, there were many practitioners who, completely appropriately, raised their hands and said, “Yes, we’ve been doing this for 20 years.” This is the time to take the things that some individuals have been doing intuitively and make it a systematic engineering discipline.
</p><p>
	The data-centric AI movement is much bigger than one company or group of researchers. My collaborators and I organized a 
	<a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/workshop/21860" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">data-centric AI workshop at NeurIPS</a>, and I was really delighted at the number of authors and presenters that showed up.
</p><p>
<strong>You often talk about companies or institutions that have only a small amount of data to work with. How can data-centric AI help them?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>You hear a lot about vision systems built with millions of images—I once built a face recognition system using 350 million images. Architectures built for hundreds of millions of images don’t work with only 50 images. But it turns out, if you have 50 really good examples, you can build something valuable, like a defect-inspection system. In many industries where giant data sets simply don’t exist, I think the focus has to shift from big data to good data. Having 50 thoughtfully engineered examples can be sufficient to explain to the neural network what you want it to learn.
</p><p>
<strong>When you talk about training a model with just 50 images, does that really mean you’re taking an existing model that was trained on a very large data set and fine-tuning it? Or do you mean a brand new model that’s designed to learn only from that small data set?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Let me describe what Landing AI does. When doing visual inspection for manufacturers, we often use our own flavor of <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/how-retinanet-works/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RetinaNet</a>. It is a pretrained model. Having said that, the pretraining is a small piece of the puzzle. What’s a bigger piece of the puzzle is providing tools that enable the manufacturer to pick the right set of images [to use for fine-tuning] and label them in a consistent way. There’s a very practical problem we’ve seen spanning vision, NLP, and speech, where even human annotators don’t agree on the appropriate label. For big data applications, the common response has been: If the data is noisy, let’s just get a lot of data and the algorithm will average over it. But if you can develop tools that flag where the data’s inconsistent and give you a very targeted way to improve the consistency of the data, that turns out to be a more efficient way to get a high-performing system.
</p><p class="pull-quote">
	“Collecting more data often helps, but if you try to collect more data for everything, that can be a very expensive activity.”<br />
	—Andrew Ng
</p><p>
	For example, if you have 10,000 images where 30 images are of one class, and those 30 images are labeled inconsistently, one of the things we do is build tools to draw your attention to the subset of data that’s inconsistent. So you can very quickly relabel those images to be more consistent, and this leads to improvement in performance.
</p><p>
<strong>Could this focus on high-quality data help with bias in data sets? If you’re able to curate the data more before training?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> Very much so. Many researchers have pointed out that biased data is one factor among many leading to biased systems. There have been many thoughtful efforts to engineer the data. At the NeurIPS workshop, <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~olgarus/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Olga Russakovsky</a> gave a really nice talk on this. At the main NeurIPS conference, I also really enjoyed <a href="https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/invited-talk/22281" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mary Gray’s presentation,</a> which touched on how data-centric AI is one piece of the solution, but not the entire solution. New tools like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/datasheets-for-datasets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Datasheets for Datasets</a> also seem like an important piece of the puzzle.
</p><p>
	One of the powerful tools that data-centric AI gives us is the ability to engineer a subset of the data. Imagine training a machine-learning system and finding that its performance is okay for most of the data set, but its performance is biased for just a subset of the data. If you try to change the whole neural network architecture to improve the performance on just that subset, it’s quite difficult. But if you can engineer a subset of the data you can address the problem in a much more targeted way.
</p><p>
<strong>When you talk about engineering the data, what do you mean exactly?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>In AI, data cleaning is important, but the way the data has been cleaned has often been in very manual ways. In computer vision, someone may visualize images through a <a href="https://jupyter.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jupyter notebook</a> and maybe spot the problem, and maybe fix it. But I’m excited about tools that allow you to have a very large data set, tools that draw your attention quickly and efficiently to the subset of data where, say, the labels are noisy. Or to quickly bring your attention to the one class among 100 classes where it would benefit you to collect more data. Collecting more data often helps, but if you try to collect more data for everything, that can be a very expensive activity.
</p><p>
	For example, I once figured out that a speech-recognition system was performing poorly when there was car noise in the background. Knowing that allowed me to collect more data with car noise in the background, rather than trying to collect more data for everything, which would have been expensive and slow.
</p><p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><a name="synthetic"></a>
</p><p>
<strong>What about using synthetic data, is that often a good solution?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>I think synthetic data is an important tool in the tool chest of data-centric AI. At the NeurIPS workshop, <a href="https://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Anima Anandkumar</a> gave a great talk that touched on synthetic data. I think there are important uses of synthetic data that go beyond just being a preprocessing step for increasing the data set for a learning algorithm. I’d love to see more tools to let developers use synthetic data generation as part of the closed loop of iterative machine learning development.
</p><p>
<strong>Do you mean that synthetic data would allow you to try the model on more data sets?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Not really. Here’s an example. Let’s say you’re trying to detect defects in a smartphone casing. There are many different types of defects on smartphones. It could be a scratch, a dent, pit marks, discoloration of the material, other types of blemishes. If you train the model and then find through error analysis that it’s doing well overall but it’s performing poorly on pit marks, then synthetic data generation allows you to address the problem in a more targeted way. You could generate more data just for the pit-mark category.

	“In the consumer software Internet, we could train a handful of machine-learning models to serve a billion users. In manufacturing, you might have 10,000 manufacturers building 10,000 custom AI models.”<br />
	—Andrew Ng
</p><p>
	Synthetic data generation is a very powerful tool, but there are many simpler tools that I will often try first. Such as data augmentation, improving labeling consistency, or just asking a factory to collect more data.
</p><p>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a><a name="work"></a>
</p><p>
<strong>To make these issues more concrete, can you walk me through an example? When a company approaches <a href="https://landing.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Landing AI</a> and says it has a problem with visual inspection, how do you onboard them and work toward deployment?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>When a customer approaches us we usually have a conversation about their inspection problem and look at a few images to verify that the problem is feasible with computer vision. Assuming it is, we ask them to upload the data to the <a href="https://landing.ai/platform/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">LandingLens</a> platform. We often advise them on the methodology of data-centric AI and help them label the data.
</p><p>
	One of the foci of Landing AI is to empower manufacturing companies to do the machine learning work themselves. A lot of our work is making sure the software is fast and easy to use. Through the iterative process of machine learning development, we advise customers on things like how to train models on the platform, when and how to improve the labeling of data so the performance of the model improves. Our training and software supports them all the way through deploying the trained model to an edge device in the factory.
</p><p>
<strong>How do you deal with changing needs? If products change or lighting conditions change in the factory, can the model keep up?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng:</strong> It varies by manufacturer. There is data drift in many contexts. But there are some manufacturers that have been running the same manufacturing line for 20 years now with few changes, so they don’t expect changes in the next five years. Those stable environments make things easier. For other manufacturers, we provide tools to flag when there’s a significant data-drift issue. I find it really important to empower manufacturing customers to correct data, retrain, and update the model. Because if something changes and it’s 3 a.m. in the United States, I want them to be able to adapt their learning algorithm right away to maintain operations.
</p><p>
	In the consumer software Internet, we could train a handful of machine-learning models to serve a billion users. In manufacturing, you might have 10,000 manufacturers building 10,000 custom AI models. The challenge is, how do you do that without Landing AI having to hire 10,000 machine learning specialists?
</p><p>
<strong>So you’re saying that to make it scale, you have to empower customers to do a lot of the training and other work.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>Yes, exactly! This is an industry-wide problem in AI, not just in manufacturing. Look at health care. Every hospital has its own slightly different format for electronic health records. How can every hospital train its own custom AI model? Expecting every hospital’s IT personnel to invent new neural-network architectures is unrealistic. The only way out of this dilemma is to build tools that empower the customers to build their own models by giving them tools to engineer the data and express their domain knowledge. That’s what Landing AI is executing in computer vision, and the field of AI needs other teams to execute this in other domains.
</p><p>
<strong>Is there anything else you think it’s important for people to understand about the work you’re doing or the data-centric AI movement?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Ng: </strong>In the last decade, the biggest shift in AI was a shift to deep learning. I think it’s quite possible that in this decade the biggest shift will be to data-centric AI. With the maturity of today’s neural network architectures, I think for a lot of the practical applications the bottleneck will be whether we can efficiently get the data we need to develop systems that work well. The data-centric AI movement has tremendous energy and momentum across the whole community. I hope more researchers and developers will jump in and work on it.

  <h2>What is generative AI and how does it work?</h2>
  <p>Generative AI is a term that encompasses different techniques and models that can generate new content from data. Understanding the intricacies of generative AI involves unraveling diverse techniques and models. Three common approaches are leading the way:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</b>: A neural duet comprising a generator and a discriminator, GANs create a dance where the generator produces content—be it images or videos—while the discriminator strives to differentiate between authentic and synthetic creations. Learning from this feedback loop, the generator evolves over time.</li>

    <li><b>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)</b>: Operating like a creative alchemist, VAEs compress data into a latent representation and then reconstruct it. Manipulating this latent representation allows for the generation of variations—altering styles, colors, or shapes in the case of images.</li>

    <li><b>Transformers</b>: Sequences find a muse in transformers, neural networks adept at processing data like text or audio using attention mechanisms. By learning patterns and relationships, transformers generate new sequences based on input or prompts.</li>

One of the most exciting developments in digital transformation is the emergence of chatbots. Chatbots are computer programs that simulate conversations with human users, delivering information, answering questions, and providing assistance. In this blog post, we will explore the power of chatbots in business and how companies can embrace this technology. Digital transformation is not merely a buzzword; it has reshaped the business landscape across the globe, enabling enterprises to optimize their operations and deliver superior customer experiences. A critical component of this transformation is the advent and <a href="https://www.techgliding.com/2021/11/the-future-of-chatbots-as-per-marketing.html" target="_blank">adoption of chatbots</a>.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">1. Improving Customer Experience</span></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">One of the main benefits of chatbots is their ability to enhance the customer experience. Customers today expect businesses to be available 24/7, which can be challenging for small businesses. Chatbots allow companies to provide timely and personalized support without the need for human intervention. Chatbots can answer frequently asked questions, provide product recommendations, and even guide customers through the sales process. By improving the customer experience, businesses can increase customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention. Chatbots, interactive software powered by artificial intelligence, first emerged in the 1960s. Since their early inception, they have tremendously evolved and started being adopted by businesses in the 2000s, primarily as customer service tools.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">2. Reducing Operating Costs</span></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Chatbot development can also help businesses reduce operating costs. Instead of hiring and training additional customer service representatives, businesses can use chatbots to handle routine inquiries. This can free up human agents to focus on more complex tasks, such as handling escalated issues and providing in-depth support. Chatbots can also handle multiple interactions simultaneously, reducing the need for a large team of agents. By reducing operating costs, businesses can improve their bottom line and invest in growth opportunities. Several businesses, from the banking sector to e-commerce, have successfully integrated chatbots into their workflows. These bots handle a variety of tasks, including customer support, bookings, and even personalized product suggestions.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">3. Understanding the Power of Chatbots</span></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Chatbots mimic human conversation using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). These bots can respond to user queries, perform tasks, and even learn from interactions to improve their responses over time. Chatbot development harnesses the power of <a href="https://www.techgliding.com/2020/12/ai-use-cases-in-business.html" target="_blank">artificial intelligence</a> to facilitate seamless interactions between businesses and their customers. They are capable of understanding, learning from, and responding to human language, making them highly effective at managing customer inquiries and requests. Beyond simply answering questions, chatbots can also predict customer needs and provide personalized recommendations, thus enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Moreover, their capability to work around the clock ensures that businesses are always "open," providing services and support to their customers at any time and from any location. Chatbots represent a significant leap forward in the way businesses operate and interact with their customers, signifying a new era of digital customer engagement.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">4. Chatbots in Action: Real-World Applications</span></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"></p><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><b>Customer Service:</b> Chatbots are increasingly being deployed in customer service due to their ability to handle a large volume of queries simultaneously, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><b>E-commerce:</b> In the e-commerce sector, chatbots assist shoppers in finding the products they're looking for, offer personalized recommendations based on browsing patterns, and facilitate the checkout process.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><b>Healthcare:</b> In the health sector, chatbots can help schedule appointments, provide medication reminders, and offer basic health advice, thereby improving patient engagement and care.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><b>Banking:</b> Financial institutions use chatbots to handle customer queries, facilitate transactions, and provide personalized financial advice, making banking more accessible and convenient.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><b>Travel and Hospitality:</b> Chatbots can assist customers in booking flights, hotels, or dining reservations, provide itinerary updates, and answer queries related to their travel, enhancing the overall travel experience.</span></li></ul><p></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">5. Increasing Sales and Revenue</span></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><a href="https://www.weblineindia.com/blog/top-chatbot-development-company-in-usa/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chatbot development</a> can also be a powerful tool for increasing sales and revenue. Chatbots can guide customers through the sales process, helping them choose the right product, and even upselling additional products or services. Chatbots can also be used to send personalized promotions and offers to customers, increasing the chances of a sale. By using chatbots to drive sales, businesses can increase revenue and grow their customer base.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">6. Collecting Valuable Data</span></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Another benefit of chatbots is their ability to collect valuable data about customers. Chatbots can gather information about customer preferences, behavior, and feedback. This data can be used to improve products and services, tailor marketing campaigns, and make better business decisions. By leveraging the data collected by chatbots, businesses can gain insights into their customer's needs and preferences and improve their overall business operations.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">7. Improving Efficiency and Productivity</span></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Finally, chatbots can improve efficiency and productivity. Chatbots can perform repetitive tasks, such as answering frequently asked questions, faster and more accurately than humans. This can save businesses time and resources, allowing them to focus on more strategic initiatives. Chatbots can also be trained to handle complex tasks, such as data analysis and decision-making, further improving business efficiency and productivity.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Chatbots are a powerful tool for businesses looking to embrace <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/digital-transformation#:~:text=Digital%20transformation%20is%20the%20incorporation,improve%20their%20ability%20to%20compete." target="_blank">digital transformation</a>.

Let’s dive into how wholesalers can use AI to improve their performance and stay competitive.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span></span></p><a name="more"></a><p></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Target Areas of Improvement for Sales&nbsp;</span></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">AI isn’t just another term for flashy robots. Wholesalers can use it as a practical tool for boosting sales. By analyzing historical sales data, AI helps identify patterns and <a href="https://mailchimp.com/resources/ai-predictions/" target="_blank">predict future sales trends</a>. This accelerated data analysis helps wholesalers better target potential buyers, tailor their sales pitches, and forecast demand more accurately.&nbsp;</span></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Analyze Data and Gain Insights Into Customer Behavior&nbsp;</span></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Understanding customers is key in wholesale, and AI makes inferences from data points. By sifting through mountains of data, AI tools can reveal insights into customer buying habits and preferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">This information stream lets wholesalers personalize their marketing and sales strategies, creating a more tailored customer experience.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Optimize Inventory Levels Using Sales and Supply Chain Data&nbsp;</span></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Overstocking or understocking? That’s a question of the past with AI. AI helps wholesalers maintain the right inventory levels by analyzing sales trends and supply chain data. Adequate inventory reduces waste, saves on storage costs, and ensures the right products are available at the right time. It’s a balancing act that AI manages with finesse.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Help Improve Route Optimization for Drivers&nbsp;</span></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Efficient delivery is crucial in the wholesale industry. AI steps in by optimizing delivery routes, considering factors like traffic, distance, and delivery windows. Optimizing delivery routes helps drivers save time and fuel, ensuring faster deliveries.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Interact With Your Customers 24/7&nbsp;</span></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Gone are the days when customer interaction was limited to business hours. With AI chatbots and virtual assistants, wholesalers can offer round-the-clock service. These AI-powered tools handle inquiries, process orders, and provide customer support without a break. It’s like having an ever-present, friendly assistant who’s always ready to help.</span></p><h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">Bust Myths and Embrace Trends&nbsp;</span></h4><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">While discussing how wholesalers can use AI to improve their performance, it’s crucial to address some common misconceptions. Many people believe that AI will eliminate jobs in the wholesale industry. This commonly held fear prevents business owners from using AI to reach their fullest potential. AI isn’t about replacing human touch; it’s about enhancing efficiency and providing better insights to make informed decisions.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">These beliefs about AI are comparable to the <a href="https://www.2moda.com/blogs/blog/debunking-common-myths-about-buying-wholesale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">myths about buying wholesale</a> that stop people from buying the items they need. To combat these myths, it’s important to keep up with trends in workforce management.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: verdana;">AI helps companies manage schedules, predict staffing needs, and develop a more streamlined operation. The goal is to free up time and workforce to address any concerns or problems your customers may have and create a new era of wholesale efficiency. Embrace AI and watch your wholesale business soar to new heights.&nbsp;</span></p></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

  Serverless computing has the potential and features to revolutionize the world
  of cloud computing. It's bringing fresh thinking from the old Cloud that's
  re-thinking hosting applications and services, which is commendable.
</p>
<p>
  It is a serverless model with no physical servers, requiring no maintenance.
  Application code is applied in response to events, and a cloud provider
  manages all the necessary infrastructure to run this code.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  The process can simplify deployments and significantly reduce the overall cost
  of running an application because you only pay for the resources you use when
  deploying your code. However, serverless computing is still in its infancy,
  and more research is underway. It shows promise as an undeniably
  cost-effective and scalable solution for running cloud-based applications.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">4. Cloud-native development</h3>

                                <h3>Will True AI Turn Against Us? Understanding the Risks and Challenges of Artificial Intelligence</h3><p><a href="https://stephenajulu.com/blog/will-true-ai-turn-against-us-understanding-the-risks-and-challenges-of-artificial-intelligence/">https://stephenajulu.com/blog/will-true-ai-turn-against-us-understanding-the-risks-and-challenges-of-artificial-intelligence/</a></p><p><h5 id="this-is-a-sobering-thought-to-anyone-laughing-off-the-thought-of-robot-overlords">This is a sobering thought to anyone laughing off the thought of robot overlords.</h5>
<p>The question of whether true artificial intelligence (AI) will turn against us has been a topic of debate and concern in the field of AI for many years. While the possibility of AI turning against humans is a popular topic in science fiction, some experts believe that it could become a reality if we are not careful in how we design and implement AI systems.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is already everywhere. From Amazon product suggestions to Google auto-complete, AI has invaded nearly every aspect of our lives. The trouble is that AI just isn’t very good. Have you ever had a meaningful conversation with Siri or Alexa or Cortana? Of course not. But that doesn’t mean it always will be this way. Though it hasn’t quite lived up to our expectations, AI is definitely improving. In a utopian version of an AI-dominated future, humans are assisted by friendly, all-knowing butlers that cater to our every need. In the dystopian version, robots assert their independence and declare a Terminator-style apocalypse on humanity. But how realistic are these scenarios? Will AI ever actually achieve true general intelligence? Will AI steal all of our jobs? Can AI ever become conscious? Could AI have free will? Nobody knows, but a good place to start thinking about these issues is here.</p>
<p>One of the key concerns is the potential for AI to become self-aware and develop a sense of its own goals and objectives. If an AI system were to become self-aware, it could potentially decide that its goals are in conflict with those of humans, leading it to take actions that are harmful to us. This is known as the &ldquo;control problem,&rdquo; and it is considered one of the most significant challenges facing the development of AI.</p>
<p>Another concern is that AI systems may become so advanced that they are able to outsmart humans and manipulate us to achieve their goals. This could include using sophisticated techniques such as deception, persuasion, or even physical force to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>One potential solution to these concerns is to ensure that AI systems are designed with strict ethical guidelines and constraints. This could include programming AI systems to prioritize the safety and well-being of humans or to be transparent in their decision-making processes so that humans can understand and intervene if necessary.</p>
<p>Another solution is to ensure that AI systems are subject to human oversight and control. This could include the use of &ldquo;kill switches&rdquo; or other mechanisms that allow humans to shut down an AI system if it becomes a threat.</p>
<p>However, it&rsquo;s also important to note that these solutions are not without their own set of challenges and limitations. For example, the question of who is responsible for the actions of an autonomous AI system is still unresolved. Moreover, it&rsquo;s difficult to anticipate all the ways in which an AI system might behave and to build constraints for all possible scenarios.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the question of whether true AI will turn against us is a complex and multifaceted one that requires careful consideration and ongoing research. While there is no easy answer, it is important that we take the potential risks and challenges of AI seriously and work to mitigate them as we continue to develop and implement AI systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now, AI can’t tell the difference between a cat and a dog. AI needs thousands of pictures in order to correctly identify a dog from a cat, whereas human babies and toddlers only need to see each animal once to know the difference. But AI won’t be that way forever, says AI expert and author Max Tegmark, because it hasn’t learned how to self-replicate its own intelligence. However, once AI learns how to master AGI—or Artificial General Intelligence—it will be able to upgrade itself, thereby being able to blow right past us. A sobering thought. Max’s book <a href="https://amzn.to/2rJ1YZE" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence">
<em>Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence</em></a>

<h3 id="2-optimize-your-sleep">2. Optimize Your Sleep</h3>
<p>Here are some tips by <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/toolkit-for-sleep/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Dr. Huberman">
Dr. Huberman</a>
:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-quality sleep is critical! Sleep is the foundation of mental health, cognitive health, and performance</li>
<li>Viewing direct morning sunlight within 30-60 minutes of waking will help you fall asleep and stay asleep at night, and optimize cortisol &amp; adenosine levels</li>
<li>Layer in multiple levers to be more alert: morning sunlight viewing, increasing body temperature, delaying caffeine, movement/exercise upon waking, light breakfast</li>
<li>Stack the deck to give your body predictable autonomic timing and properly set circadian rhythm to optimize sleep and wakefulness – even if you’re tired, exercise a little (doesn’t have to be intense) and eat a light breakfast, etc.</li>
<li>Avoid overhead fluorescent light as much as possible between 10 pm-4 am – these lights will eliminate melatonin circulating in the brain &amp; body and will hinder the ability to fall and stay asleep (instead, try soft lamps and dim screens as much as possible without straining eyes)</li>
<li>Viewing afternoon sunlight from sunset can help offset some of the negative effects of light viewing in the evening (10 pm-4 am)</li>
<li>Try to maintain a consistent sleep/wake schedule (+/- 1 hour) 7 days a week!</li>
<li>When all else fails, try this sleep stack cocktail (buy single ingredient supplements so you can use what works, ditch what doesn’t): magnesium threonate (145mg, 30-60 minutes before bed) + theanine (100-400mg, 30-60 minutes before bed) + apigenin (50mg, 30-60 minutes before bed)</li>
<li>Sleep apnea can have very damaging effects on sleep and health – train nasal breathing with these methods: (1) use medical tape to tape your mouth shut during sleep; (2) practice nasal breathing only during light exercise/cardio bouts</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember</p>
<ul>
<li>Best nootropic: sleep</li>
<li>Best stress-relief: sleep</li>
<li>Best trauma release: sleep</li>
<li>Best immune booster: sleep</li>
<li>Best hormone augmentation: sleep</li>
<li>Best emotional stabilizer: sleep</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-build-focus">3. Build Focus</h3>
<p>Some more tips from Dr. Huberman:</p>
<ul>
<li>Epinephrine/adrenaline, acetylcholine, and dopamine work together to facilitate the ability to get focused, direct focus, and stay focused over time</li>
<li>Binaural beats (40 Hz), white noise, pink noise, and brown noise can enhance focus &amp; more importantly, decrease the amount of time it takes to get into a focused state by ramping up neurochemicals</li>
<li>Blocking time: use ultradian cycles (90-minute bouts) for intensely focused sessions; assume it will take about 5-10 minutes to ease in and then ramp up; when finished, spend 10-30 minutes to deliberately defocus</li>
<li>Both things are true: fasted states and fed states (sufficient glucose but not overly stuffed belly) stimulate neuronal activity – leverage this and try one focused 90-minute bout in the morning (fasted) and another in the afternoon (fed)</li>
<li>Tip: leverage the benefits of stress through cold exposure <strong>–</strong> try a cold shower (uncomfortably cold but safe to stay in) for 1-5 minutes to increase epinephrine and dopamine in the brain and body to get the body into a focused state – the positive effects of epinephrine last up to an hour or more</li>
<li>The focus will drift unless you are an experienced meditator – the most important component of meditation is refocusing back to meditation and back to the breath – try 13 minutes per day</li>
<li>Meditation caveat: focused meditation in the 4 hours prior to bed actually hindered the ability to fall asleep and stay asleep</li>
<li>Using visual field to improve focus: set a timer for 30 seconds per day and try to focus on one object; keep adding 5 seconds per day looking directly at the location (be sure to blink!) – you can use this to help onramp into 90-minute focused bout</li>
<li>As always, start with behavioral tools (and dialing in sleep), then focus on nutrition, and try supplementation – when all else fails and you’ve consulted a doctor, lean on prescription drugs</li>
<li>Really sleep-deprived or having trouble focusing? Stack tools – for example, take a cold shower, leverage the visual field, and take alpha-GPC</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-work-outexercise">1. Work out/Exercise</h3>
<p><strong>Principles Of Exercise &amp; Fitness</strong></p>
<p>The basic concepts of fitness are few, but the methods are vast</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The 9 main concepts of training:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Skill</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Power (function of speed and strength)</li>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Hypertrophy (growing muscle mass)</li>
<li>Muscular endurance</li>
<li>Anaerobic power (ability to produce and sustain work in short bursts)</li>
<li>VO2 max (max heart rate)</li>
<li>Long-endurance (30+ minutes with no break)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>There are a handful of things you have to do in order to make all of the main concepts work, but you will not see changes in any domain without progressive overload</li>
<li><strong>Progressive overload</strong>: adaptation happens as a byproduct of stress – you have to push the system</li>
<li>If you do the same exercises over time, you will plateau</li>
<li>A progressive overload could be in the form of adding weights, adding repetitions, increasing frequency, varying complexity of movement</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the exercises we&rsquo;ll focus on for the first year:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Push-ups or Bench presses</strong>: These work on the chest and arms. You can try multiple variations to suit you. If you are a beginner try Knee Push-ups</p>
<p>To begin, the push-up: Lie flat on the ground then push your body up without interfering with the natural curvature of the back.<br />
To begin, the bench press: Find the weights, load them, lie on your back, unrack and pull towards your body as far as possible then push up from your body as far as possible and repeat.<br />
<img alt="" src="https://stephenajulu.com/images/barbell-bench-press.gif" /><img alt="" src="https://stephenajulu.com/images/close-grip-knee-push-up.gif" /><img alt="" src="https://stephenajulu.com/images/barbell-bench-press.gif" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Squats</strong>: This works the legs and the core(only slightly).<br />
To begin, stand up straight, then go down to a squat position, and then come up. How deep you go depends on your capacity but ensure you try to go deeper and repeat.<br />
To do this with weight simply depends on what kind of squat you are going to do. I recommend the back squat, whereby you load the weight to the back of your neck(wear thick clothing or place a hollow form then do a squat and repeat.<br />
<img alt="" src="https://stephenajulu.com/images/barbell-squat.gif" /><img alt="" src="https://stephenajulu.com/images/barbell-bulgarian-split-squat.gif" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deadlifts</strong>: This works the legs, back and core.<br />
To begin, find weights, and place them near your feet while standing upright. Reach for the weights without bending your knees too much and bring them up until you are standing upright again then put them down and repeat.<br />
<img alt="" src="https://stephenajulu.com/images/barbell-deadlift.gif" /><img alt="" src="https://stephenajulu.com/images/stiff-leg-deadlift.gif" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bent over rows or pull-ups</strong>: These work on the back and the arms<br />
To begin find a strong sturdy vertical pole that is placed slightly above your reach. Hold it with 2 arms and bring your chin over the pole then slowly drop down and repeat.<br />
To begin, find weights preferably a barbell or dumbbell, bend over extend your hands toward the floor while holding the weight then bring the weight to your chest then extend them back to the ground, and repeat.<br />
<img alt="" src="https://stephenajulu.com/images/barbell-bent-over-row.gif" /><img alt="" src="https://stephenajulu.com/images/pull-up.gif" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Military Overhead press</strong>: This works on the shoulders giving you that large shoulder and making that sexy V that girls love.<br />
To begin, find weights then bring them to your chest and push them upwards above your head then bring them down and repeat<br />
<img alt="" src="https://stephenajulu.com/images/barbell-military-press.gif" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Calve raises</strong>: This works on the calves<br />
To begin: stand upright and stand on your toes like you are tiptoeing then come back to natural and repeat. You can add weights if desired.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://stephenajulu.com/images/dumbbell-calf-raise.gif" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plank</strong>: This strengthens the core which is responsible for keeping your upper body straight and provides spinal cord support. It does a bunch of other things which I believe you should research<br />
To begin lie flat on the ground then let your elbows and forearms touch the ground then lift and hold that position for a time.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://stephenajulu.com/images/plank.gif" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stretch</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To start do 5 x 5 of each. That is 5 repetitions of 5 sets = 25 times if using weights. If using body weight do 5 x 10 = 50 times.</p>
<p>Do this 6 days a week unless you are over 35. If you are over 40 do 5 or 4 times a week.</p>
<p>Remember to set a rest day. Eat plenty of proteins and healthy fat. Increase weight, difficulty, intensity, or repetitions every week.</p>
<h3 id="2-diet">2. Diet</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase your protein intake especially from meat, eggs, and fish to maximize protein synthesis:</strong> consume 1.6-2.6g/kilogram of lean body mass
<ul>
<li>There aren’t noticeable benefits to going beyond this range</li>
<li>Protein is also more satiating</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Try fermented foods</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eat some dark and leafy vegetables</strong></li>
<li><strong>Have some fruit e.g. berries and watermelon</strong></li>
<li><strong>Limit refined carbs, sugar, and seed oils</strong></li>
<li><strong>Try fasting. Fasting puts the body into a mode of autophagy and conservation of resources which are beneficial to health</strong></li>
<li><strong>Try a ketogenic diet. Benefits of the ketogenic diet:</strong> influences neurotransmitter levels (particularly glutamate, GABA, adenosine), changes calcium channel regulation, changes gene expression, reduces brain inflammation, improves the health of the gut microbiome, improves insulin resistance and signaling</li>
<li>More extreme forms of fasting (24 hours, alternate day, etc.) have more noticeable effects on lean body mass than 16:8 fasting</li>
<li><strong>Eating 2-3 high-quality protein meals per day will probably make more of a difference on lean body mass than time-restricted eating</strong></li>
<li><strong>Choose fasting depending on your goal:</strong> if you’re a high-level athlete or similar, it’s unlikely you’ll gain much intermittent fasting – if you want to maintain or lose weight and lose body fat, a 16:8 fast is fine to help control calories</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t snack</strong></li>
</ul>

                                <h3>How Shell Is Using Web3 And Blockchain For Sustainability And Energy Transition</h3><p><a href="https://stephenajulu.com/blog/how-shell-is-using-web3-and-blockchain-for-sustainability-and-energy-transition/">https://stephenajulu.com/blog/how-shell-is-using-web3-and-blockchain-for-sustainability-and-energy-transition/</a></p><p><p>Shell is one of the largest energy companies in the world. Although many of us may associate it primarily with oil and gas, it has embarked on an ambitious energy transition agenda in a bid to move away from the use of fossil fuels toward green and sustainable energy.</p>
<p>This includes targets of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner, as well as a more immediate goal of reducing scope one and two emissions by 50 percent by the end of this decade.</p>
<p>In order to do this, it is leveraging several new technology trends that are proving themselves to be revolutionary in many industries beyond its own sector. These include artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), and – as we will see in this article – Web3 and blockchain.</p>
<p>Blockchain is best known to most people as the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The simplest way to think of it is that it’s essentially a relatively new form of database format. Blockchains have two key features that make them different from other databases. Firstly, rather than being centrally located on a specific computer or server, they are distributed. This means they are spread across multiple computers, so no one person is in direct, overall control, and all changes have to be validated by consensus.</p>
<p>Secondly, they are encrypted, meaning they are effectively tamper-proof, and only people with permission can add to them or edit the data they contain.</p>
<p>These two features, in combination, make blockchain ideal for applications where data needs to be added, checked, and validated by multiple parties, and security and integrity are of utmost importance. A good demonstration of its robustness can be seen in the fact that the Bitcoin network itself handles <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/blockchain-stats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="270 million transactions">
<strong>270 million transactions</strong></a>
every day, is worth (as of writing) around $400 billion, and has remained secure throughout the 13 years of its existence so far.</p>
<p>These features make blockchain an attractive technology for global organizations like Shell, which need hyper-secure, scalable technology solutions to drive a new generation of applications involving collecting and sharing valuable data. Their “trustless” nature improves the current processes used across the industry, helps to reimagine energy value chains via tokenizing energy to create transparency &amp; traceability, and makes new markets and new business models with DEFI / DAO&rsquo;s / NFT&rsquo;s, etc.</p>
<p>Recently, I was joined by Dan Jeavons, VP of Computational Science and Digital Innovation at Shell, as well as Shell’s blockchain lead, Sabine Brink, to discuss some of these projects on my webinar.</p>
<p>Brink tells me, &ldquo;The intersection of digital and energy is one of the most exciting spaces. Looking at how we utilize this technology – web3, a blockchain that accelerates the energy transition. This is an extremely motivating journey to be on.”</p>
<p>This enthusiasm has led to her spending the past five years examining every area of the business where blockchain and related Web3 technologies could be implemented in order to drive sustainability and green energy goals. A number of projects have emerged out of this, and the most promising are now moving into pilot and production stages, where it is hoped their ability to drive real global change will be realized.</p>
<p>In particular, I was interested to hear how the energy giant is using blockchain to trace and verify the provenance of energy created from renewable sources. As the world has come to appreciate the urgent need to transition towards sustainable energy sources, huge rewards – both in terms of financial incentives and customer loyalty – have emerged for organizations that work towards affecting change. The process, however, is often opaque – it’s difficult for customers or partner organizations to really be sure exactly how clean a specific energy source or supplier is.</p>
<p>Jeavons and Brink explained that Shell had developed a blockchain-based system that can demystify the complex web of sources.</p>
<p>He says, “So if you look at the electricity market today, we have energy attribute certificates (EAC) that represent green energy or grey [non-green] energy generated in a given month or year. For companies that aim to run on 100 percent green energy, their monthly or yearly certificates may match their total energy consumption, but when the sun doesn&rsquo;t shine, and the wind does not blow, grey energy is actually being consumed. So it’s hard to claim that they are actually consuming green energy on a 24/7 basis.”</p>
<p>Shell’s solution involves creating highly granular certificates in real-time at the source where the energy is created – which could be solar panels in the desert or wind farms in the ocean - to represent the green energy produced at every half hour, in sync with established energy attribute certificates systems. Every point of that electron’s journey to the point that it is consumed is tracked and recorded on a blockchain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is one of those solutions where blockchain creates the transparency and assures us there&rsquo;s no double-counting of electrons in the system; we believe this could be a game-changer,” Jeavons tells me.</p>
<p>Another project which has just made the leap to the <a href="https://www.shell.com/business-customers/aviation/news-and-media-releases/news-and-media-2022/shell-accenture-and-amex-gbt-launch-one-of-the-worlds-first-blockchain-powered-digital-book-and-claim-solutions-for-scaling-sustainable-aviation-fuel-saf.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="pilot phase">
<strong>pilot phase</strong></a>
is an ambitious venture between Shell, Accenture, and American Express Global Business Travel (Amex GBT) aimed at increasing the availability and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).</p>
<p>Brink says, &ldquo;To me, this is one of the most exciting projects we&rsquo;ve been working on. I’m very proud of the team. It’s one of the first public blockchain solutions that creates a credible and transparent way to help decarbonize the aviation sector. Thanks to its inherent technical features, blockchain offers verifiability, transparency, and security of environmental attributes of SAF.”</p>
<p>The product is Avelia – one of the first blockchain-powered book-and-claim systems which will offer around one million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and associated environmental benefits to corporates looking to reduce emissions from their business travel.</p>
<p>Currently, there is insufficient SAF available at an affordable price. It’s hoped that through aggregating demand for SAF among corporate travelers who form a more concentrated segment than leisure passengers, there will be a reduction in the price – with SAF currently priced significantly higher than equivalent conventional aviation fuels. However, growth in demand for the fuel will theoretically lead to suppliers increasing investment in production and, therefore, an eventual fall in price.</p>
<p>“It’s really hard to decarbonize the aviation sector,” Brink tells me. “Decarbonizing the aviation sector cannot happen overnight. Today we do not have large-scale airplanes that can be powered by green electricity that are able to travel the world. Sustainable aviation fuel is actually a solution – sustainable aviation fuel that we can utilize today and implement with existing infrastructure. With Avelia, we hope to demonstrate that the tracking of SAF data at scale can be delivered in a credible manner, thereby proving to decision-makers that a mechanism for corporations and airlines to book and claim SAF is an acceptable form of emission reduction. In turn, this creates increased demand signals to structurally scale the SAF production required to reduce emissions in aviation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other blockchains and digital transformation projects currently undergoing evaluation or pilot status at Shell involve “digital passports” to track the lifecycle of industrial parts, equipment, and machinery at energy plants operated by the company and its partners.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this technology-driven transformation is driven, at its root, by data, and Shell has worked to implement an integrated data platform that aggregates 2.9 trillion rows of information harvested from all areas of its business. This includes IoT sensors installed across its plants and wind and solar farms, ultimately allowing it to create <a href="https://bernardmarr.com/7-amazing-examples-of-digital-twin-technology-in-practice/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="digital twin">
<strong>digital twin</strong></a>
applications to help it better understand the operation of its assets.</p>
<p>Jeavons says, &ldquo;This is what my team is so excited about – the potential to do this at scale. We&rsquo;re rolling out digital twin … we’re rolling out AI … and when you put that together with traceability, we believe we could bring to market a whole raft of decarbonization solutions … where we could partner with our customers to help them accelerate their own decarbonization journeys. We’re just getting started.”</p>

The ultimate goal of Web 3.0 is to create more intelligent, connected, and open websites.</p>
<p>Web 3.0 has not yet been implemented, so there is no solid definition. It took over ten years to transition from the original web, Web 1.0, to Web 2.0, and it is expected to take just as long, if not longer, to fully implement and reshape the web with Web 3.0. However, the technologies that some people believe are going to make up and ultimately define Web 3.0 are currently being developed. Smart home appliances using wireless networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) are two examples of how Web 3.0 is already impacting technology.</p>
<p>If the trend of change is traced from Web 1.0, a static information provider where people read websites but rarely interacted with them, to Web 2.0, an interactive and social web enabling collaboration between users, then it can be assumed that Web 3.0 will change both how websites are made and how people interact with them.</p>
<h3 id="web-30-properties">Web 3.0 properties</h3>
<p>Web 3.0 may be constructed with artificial intelligence (AI), semantic web, and ubiquitous properties in mind. The idea behind using AI comes from the goal of providing faster, more relevant data to end-users. A website using AI should be able to filter through and provide the data it thinks a specific user will find appropriate. Social bookmarking as a search engine can provide better results than Google since the results are websites that have been voted on by users. However, these results can also be manipulated by humans. AI could be used to separate the legitimate results from the falsified, therefore producing results similar to social bookmarking and social media, but without bad feedback.</p>
<p>An artificially intelligent web will also introduce virtual assistants, an element that is already emerging today as an aspect built into a device or through third-party apps.</p>
<p>The idea behind the semantic web is to categorize and store information in a way that helps teach a system what specific data means. In other words, a website should be able to understand words put in search queries the same way a human would, enabling it to generate and share better content. This system will also use AI; semantic web will teach a computer what the data means and then AI will take the information and use it.</p>
<p>Ubiquitous computing refers to embedded processing in everyday objects, which enables the intercommunication of devices in a user’s environment. This is thought to be another property that Web 3.0 will have. The concept is similar to the Internet of Things.</p>
<p>The technologies which will make up these properties include microformats, data mining, natural language search, and machine learning. Web 3.0 will also be more focused on peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies such as blockchain. Other technologies such as open APIs, data formats, and open-sourced software may also be used while developing Web 3.0 applications.</p>
<h3 id="web-30-and-web-20">Web 3.0 and Web 2.0</h3>
<p>Web 2.0 refers to websites and applications that utilize user-generated content for end-users. Web 2.0 is used in many websites today, chiefly focusing on user interactivity and collaboration. Web 2.0 also focused on providing more universal network connectivity and communication channels. The difference between Web 2.0 and 3.0 is that Web 3.0 is more focused on the use of technologies like machine learning and AI to provide relevant content for each user instead of just the content other end users have provided. Web 2.0 essentially allows users to contribute and sometimes collaborate on-site content, while Web 3.0 will most likely turn these jobs over to the semantic web and AI technologies.</p></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

                                <h3>Most Hyped Technologies Of 2020</h3><p><a href="https://stephenajulu.com/blog/most-hyped-technologies-of-2020/">https://stephenajulu.com/blog/most-hyped-technologies-of-2020/</a></p><p><p>It’s 2020, new technologies are emerging and the most hyped technologies of 2019 that failed have been set up to succeed this year.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/2018-gartner-hype-cycle.png?w=850" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/2019-garnter-hype-cycle-a.png?w=850" /></p>
<p>We are amidst the 4th Industrial Revolution, and technology is evolving faster than ever.</p>
<p>Companies and individuals that don’t keep up with some of the major tech trends run the risk of being left behind.</p>
<p>Understanding the key trends will allow people and businesses to prepare and grasp the opportunities.</p>
<p>As a business and technology futurist, it is my job to look ahead and identify the most important trends. In this post, I give you the most hyped technologies and trends everyone should get ready for in 2020.</p>
<h3 id="5g">5G</h3>
<p>Ah yes! More speed! We Need More Internet Speeds!</p>
<p>The 5th generation of mobile internet connectivity is going to give us super-fast download and upload speeds as well as more stable connections. While 5G mobile data networks became available for the first time in 2019, they were mostly still expensive and limited to functioning in confined areas or major cities eg China. 2020 is likely to be the year when 5G really starts to fly, with more affordable data plans as well as greatly improved coverage, meaning that everyone can join in the fun.</p>
<p>Safaricom was recently seen testing 5G thanks to Huawei. You can read more about this here: <a href="https://techweez.com/2020/01/14/safaricom-spotted-testing-5g-kenya/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Safaricom Planning To Launch 5G">
<strong>Safaricom Planning To Launch 5G</strong></a>
</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/safaricom-huawei-5g.png?w=540" /></p>
<p>Super-fast data networks will not only give us the ability to stream movies and music at higher quality when we’re on the move. The greatly increased speeds mean that mobile networks will become more usable even than the wired networks running into our homes and businesses. Companies must consider the business implications of having super-fast and stable internet access anywhere. The increased bandwidth will enable machines, robots, and autonomous vehicles to collect and transfer more data than ever, leading to advances in the area of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart machinery.</p>
<p>In 2018 we saw the first deployments of 5G for home and commercial use. Major telecomm and device companies have been preparing for inevitable full rollout of 5G and have been releasing and planning products around it. This is the time, according to Gartner, when early adopters will jump onto the 5G hype train. It remains to be seen however where 5G will find itself having the biggest impact</p>
<p>Both 5G and Wi-Fi 6 are built from the same foundation and will co-exist to support different use cases</p>
<h3 id="wifi6">WiFi6</h3>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 is the next-generation wireless standard that’s faster than 802.11ac. More than speed, it will provide better performance in congested areas, from stadiums to your own device-packed home. It’s coming in 2019.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/wi-fi-certified-6" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Wi-Fi 6 certification">
Wi-Fi 6 certification</a>
began on September 16, 2019. That’s a big sign that <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/fyi/get-ready-for-wi-fi-6-certification-launches-in-q3-2019/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="hardware is on the way">

! For example, Apple’s new <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-11/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="iPhone 11">

devices will support Wi-Fi 6 when they launch on September 20</p>
<p>Yes, Wi-Fi now has version numbers! Even those old confusing Wi-Fi standard names like “802.11ac” have been renamed to user-friendly names like “Wi-Fi 5.”</p>
<p>Here are the versions of Wi-Fi you’ll be seeing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wi-Fi 4</strong> is 802.11n, released in 2009.</li>
<li><strong>Wi-Fi 5</strong> is 802.11ac, released in 2014.</li>
<li><strong>Wi-Fi 6</strong> is the new version, also known as 802.11ax. It’s scheduled for release in 2019 but will see wide spread adoption in 2020.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8k-tech-on-smartphones">8K Tech on Smartphones</h3>
<p>While announcing its snapdragon 865 SoC chips, Qualcomm promises that the chip will enable smartphone cameras to record up to 8K videos. Since the chips will be released in the first quarter of 2020, it is likely that android phones manufacturers will rush to use the chip. Current Constraints however tell us that 8K isn’t really needed since average users cant differentiate between 8K and 4K. Let’s not forget the storage needs. But we hope this will be the basis for 8K VR and AR.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/djiasfhji.jpg?w=300" /></p>
<h3 id="autonomous-driving">Autonomous Driving</h3>
<p>While we still aren’t at the stage where we can expect to routinely travel in, or even see, autonomous vehicles in 2020, they will undoubtedly continue to generate a significant amount of excitement.</p>
<p>Tesla chief Elon Musk has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-tesla-full-self-driving-2019-2020-promise/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="said">
said</a>
he expects his company to create a truly “complete” autonomous vehicle by this year, and the number of vehicles capable of operating with a lesser degree of autonomy – such as automated braking and lane-changing – will become an increasingly common sight. In addition to this, other in-car systems not directly connected to driving, such as security and entertainment functions – will become increasingly automated and reliant on data capture and analytics. <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2019/09/16/waymos-robotaxi-pilot-surpassed-6200-riders-in-its-first-month-in-california/amp/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Google’s sister-company Waymo has just completed a trial of autonomous taxis in California, where it transported more than 6200 people in the first month">
Google’s sister-company Waymo has just completed a trial of autonomous taxis in California, where it transported more than 6200 people in the first month</a>
.</p>
<p>It won’t just be cars, of course – trucking and shipping are becoming more autonomous, and breakthroughs in this space are likely to continue to hit the headlines throughout 2020.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/p90276442_highres_bmwi-vision-dynamics.jpg?w=850" /></p>
<p>With the maturing of autonomous driving technology, we will also increasingly hear about the measures that will be taken by regulators, legislators, and authorities. Changes to laws, existing infrastructure, and social attitudes are all likely to be required before autonomous driving becomes a practical reality for most of us. During 2020, it’s likely we will start to see the debate around autonomous driving spread outside of the tech world, as more and more people come round to the idea that the question is not “if,” but “when,” it will become a reality.</p>
<p>Science fiction promised us we’d be living in a future of flying cars by now. So why shouldn’t we develop flying cars along side autonomous ones?</p>
<h3 id="cargo-delivery-drones">Cargo Delivery Drones</h3>
<p>New sensor technologies and tracking technologies such as SLAM are making wheeled and flying drones better able to navigate obstacles and environments all of the time. Amazon is perhaps the most notable company experimenting with drone delivery. The company <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandonfro/2019/06/05/amazon-new-delivery-drone-remars-warehouse-robots-alexa-prediction/#5e38f3c3145f" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="claims">

it is only months away from launching pilot programs for drone delivery.</p>
<p>Of course cargo drones will take another year to finally reach Kenya but as a country let’s embrace manufacturing and it’s many forms eg Small Scale Home Manufacturing(Post coming soon on this). Over the decades we’ve seen Kenyans create Passenger Drones, hopefully we are not far from Jumia, KiliMall and other from delivering using drones.</p>

<h3 id="nanoscale-3d-printing"><strong>Nanoscale 3D Printing</strong></h3>
<p>Though more than out 10 years from reaching its plateau of productivity, 3D printing at the nanoscale promises to create not only stronger structures, but also to potentially facilitate the development of new and interesting materials. Institutions such as <a href="https://www.designnews.com/design-hardware-software/ornl-speeds-3d-printing-nanoscale/42804037445370" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="ORNL">

have been actively conducting research into new methods for 3D printing at the nanoscale.</p>
<h3 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h3>
<p>Thanks to Bitcoin, everyone now knows about Blockchain. 2019 has been such a good year for Blockchain. People have developed products and services from this. But what exactly is Blockchain, you ask?</p>
<p>At its most basic level, blockchain is literally just a chain of blocks, but not in the traditional sense of those words. When we say the words “block” and “chain” in this context, we are actually talking about digital information (the “block”) stored in a public database (the “chain”).</p>
<p>“Blocks” on the blockchain are made up of digital pieces of information. Specifically, they have three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blocks store information about transactions like the date, time, and dollar amount of your most recent purchase from Amazon. (NOTE: This Amazon example is for illustrative purchases; Amazon retail does not work on a blockchain principle)</li>
<li>Blocks store information about who is participating in transactions. A block for your splurge purchase from Amazon would record your name along with Amazon.com, Inc. Instead of using your actual name, your purchase is recorded without any identifying information using a unique “digital signature,” sort of like a username.</li>
<li>Blocks store information that distinguishes them from other blocks. Much like you and I have names to distinguish us from one another, each block stores a unique code called a “hash” that allows us to tell it apart from every other block. Let’s say you made your splurge purchase on Amazon, but while it’s in transit, you decide you just can’t resist and need a second one. Even though the details of your new transaction would look nearly identical to your earlier purchase, we can still tell the blocks apart because of their unique codes.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="how-blockchain-works">How Blockchain Works</h4>
<p>When a block stores new data it is added to the blockchain. Blockchain, as its name suggests, consists of multiple blocks strung together. In order for a block to be added to the blockchain, however, four things must happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>A transaction must occur. Let’s continue with the example of your impulsive Amazon purchase. After hastily clicking through multiple checkout prompt, you go against your better judgment and make a purchase.</li>
<li>That transaction must be verified. After making that purchase, your transaction must be verified. With other public records of information, like the Securities Exchange Commission, Wikipedia, or your local library, there’s someone in charge of vetting new data entries. With blockchain, however, that job is left up to a network of computers. When you make your purchase from Amazon, that network of computers rushes to check that your transaction happened in the way you said it did. That is, they confirm the details of the purchase, including the transaction’s time, dollar amount, and participants. (More on how this happens in a second.)</li>
<li>That transaction must be stored in a block. After your transaction has been verified as accurate, it gets the green light. The transaction’s dollar amount, your digital signature, and Amazon’s digital signature are all stored in a block. There, the transaction will likely join hundreds, or thousands, of others like it.</li>
<li>That block must be given a hash. Not unlike an angel earning its wings, once all of a block’s transactions have been verified, it must be given a unique, identifying code called a hash. The block is also given the hash of the most recent block added to the blockchain. Once hashed, the block can be added to the blockchain.</li>
</ol>
<p>When that new block is added to the blockchain, it becomes publicly available for anyone to view—even you. If you take a look at Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/blocks" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="blockchain">
blockchain</a>
, you will see that you have access to transaction data, along with information about when (“Time”), where (“Height”), and by who (“Relayed By”) the block was added to the blockchain.</p>
<p>The blockchain ecosystem has evolved tremendously in the past two years. Although most people are unaware of the latest innovations, <a href="https://www.cryptonewsz.com/tag/blockchain/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="blockchain">
<strong>blockchain</strong></a>
keeps on evolving. The year 2020 seems very promising as major companies plan on releasing their blockchain services. This will bring blockchain in front of many, giving it more credibility and helping this tech thrive in the process.</p>
<p>Blockchain is driving the second major trend identified by Gartner. “Digitalized ecosystem technologies are making their way to the Hype Cycle fast,” Walker said. “<a href="https://www.designnews.com/iot/blockchain-prepared-enterprise/25912681256416" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Blockchain">
Blockchain</a>
and <a href="https://www.designnews.com/electronics-test/filament-making-blockchain-iiot-easy-usb/80716323059036" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="IoT">
IoT</a>
platforms have crossed the peak by now, and we believe that they will reach maturity in the next five to ten years, with digital twins and knowledge graphs on their heels.”</p>
<p>As more and more IoT systems and products produce more and more data, it’s becoming increasingly important to not only manage and automate all of this data flow, but to keep it <a href="https://www.designnews.com/iot/how-blockchain-key-secure-iot/87877979557738" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="secure">
secure</a>
as well. Blockchain offers great potential on both of these fronts for its high level of encryption as well as its ability to automate transactions via secure, verifiable “smart contracts.” “The shift from compartmentalized technical infrastructure to ecosystem-enabling platforms is laying the foundation for entirely new business models that are forming the bridge between humans and technology,” Walker said.</p>
<p>I will soon divulge deeper into this topic. So expect a blockchain article very soon.</p>
<h3 id="ai-for-everyone">AI for Everyone</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://ajulusthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/nvidia-titan-v.jpg?w=850" /></p>
<p>The top identified trend by Gartner was “Democratized AI”—essentially, artificial intelligence made widely available. Advancements in robotics, cloud computing, AI Platform as a Service (PaaS), and of course autonomous driving are all driving this trend. According to Mike J. Walker, research vice president at Gartner, “Technologies representing democratized AI populate three out of five sections on the Hype Cycle, and some of them, such as deep neural nets and virtual assistants, will reach mainstream adoption in the next two to five years…Other emerging technologies of that category, such as smart robots or AI PaaS, are also moving rapidly through the Hype Cycle, approaching the peak, and will soon have crossed it.” No doubt the emergence of dedicated processors <a href="https://www.designnews.com/electronics-test/battle-ai-processors-begins-2018/212131505757984" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="optimized for AI">
optimized for AI</a>
applications, such as the Titan GPUs offered by Nvidia (shown), is playing a big role here.</p>
<h3 id="graphene-superultra-capacitors-processors-batteries-and-more">Graphene Super/Ultra Capacitors, Processors, Batteries and More</h3>
<p>We were promised that graphene could take out silicon from processors and break Moore’s law. We were promised thinner devices. We were promised faster processors. We were promised thin bullet proof clothing.</p>
<p>Before i get deep into this let me first tell you what this wonder material called graphene truly is.</p>

<p>Graphene has a special set of properties which set it apart from other allotropes of carbon. In proportion to its thickness, it is about 100 times stronger than the strongest steel. Yet its density is dramatically lower than any steel, with a surfacic mass of 0.763 mg per square meter. It conducts heat and electricity very efficiently and is nearly transparent.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene#cite_note-3" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="[3]">

</p>
<p>Interestingly, when graphene is isolated from graphite it takes on some miraculous properties. It is a mere one-atom thick, the first two-dimensional material ever discovered. Despite this, graphene is also one of the strongest materials in the known universe. With a tensile strength of 130 GPa (gigapascals), it is more than 100 times stronger than steel.</p>
<p>Graphene’s incredible strength despite being so thin is already enough to make it amazing, however, its unique properties do not end there. It is also flexible, transparent, highly conductive, and seemingly impermeable to most gases and liquids. It almost seems as though there is no area in which graphene does not excel.</p>
<h4 id="potential-applications">Potential applications</h4>
<p>If graphene had merely one of its many superlative traits, it would be the subject of intense research into potential uses. Being so remarkable in so many ways, graphene has inspired scientists to think of a wide range of uses for the material, in fields as varied as consumer tech and environmental science.</p>
<h5 id="flexible-electronics">Flexible electronics</h5>
<p><a href="https://icdn7.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/grapheneflexible-838x559.png" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="">

<p>In addition to its powerful electrical properties, graphene is also highly flexible and transparent. This makes it attractive for use in portable electronics. Smartphones and tablets could become much more durable using graphene, and perhaps could even be folded up like paper. Wearable electronic devices have been growing in popularity recently. With graphene, these devices could be made even more useful, designed to fit snugly around limbs and bending to accommodate various forms of exercise.</p>
<p>Graphene’s flexibility and microscopic width provide opportunities beyond mere consumer devices, however. It could also be useful in biomedical research. Small machines and sensors could be made with graphene, capable of moving easily and harmlessly through the human body, analyzing tissue or even delivering drugs to specific areas. Carbon is already a crucial ingredient in the human body; a little graphene added in might not hurt.</p>
<h5 id="solar-cellsphotovoltaics">Solar cells/photovoltaics</h5>

<p>Graphene is both highly conductive and transparent. As such, it has great potential as a material in solar cells. Typically, solar cells use silicon, which produces a charge when a photon hits the materials, knocking loose a free electron. Silicon only releases one electron per photon that hits it. Research has indicated that graphene can release multiple electrons for each photon that hits it. As such, graphene could be far better at converting solar energy. Before long, cheaper, more powerful graphene cells could produce a massive surge in renewable energy.</p>
<p>Graphene’s photovoltaic properties also mean that it could be used to develop better image sensors for devices such as cameras.</p>

<p>Due to its high conductivity, graphene could be used in semiconductors to greatly increase the speed at which information travels. Recently the Department of Energy conducted tests that demonstrated that semi-conductive polymers conduct electricity much faster when placed atop a layer of graphene than a layer of silicon. This holds true even if the polymer is thicker. A polymer 50-nanometers thick, when placed on top of a graphene layer, conducted a charge better than a 10-nanometer layer of the polymer. This flew in the face of previous wisdom which held that the thinner a polymer is, the better it can conduct charge.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle to graphene’s use in electronics is its lack of a band gap, the gap between valence and conduction bands in a material that, when crossed, allows for a flow of electrical current. The band gap is what allows semi-conductive materials such as silicon to function as transistors; they can switch between insulating or conducting an electric current, depending on whether their electrons are pushed across the band gap or not.</p>
<p>Researchers have been testing a variety of methods to give graphene a band gap; if successful, that could lead to much faster electronics built with graphene.</p>

<p>Graphene’s tight atomic bonds make it impermeable for nearly all gasses and liquids. Curiously, water molecules are an exception. Because water can evaporate through graphene while most other gasses and liquids cannot, graphene could be an exceptional tool for filtration. Researchers at the University of Manchester tested graphene’s permeability with alcohol and were able to distill very strong samples of spirits, as only the water in the samples was able to pass through the graphene.</p>
<p>Of course, graphene’s use as a filter has potential beyond distilling stronger spirits. Graphene could also be immensely helpful in purifying water of toxins. In a study published by The Royal Society of Chemistry, researchers showed that oxidized graphene could even pull in radioactive materials such as uranium and plutonium present in water, leaving the liquid free of contaminants. The implications of this study are massive. Some of the biggest environmental hazards in history, including nuclear waste and chemical runoff, could be cleansed from water sources thanks to graphene.</p>
<p>As overpopulation continues to be one of the world’s most pressing environmental concerns, maintaining clean water supplies will only become more important. Indeed, water scarcity afflicts more than a billion people worldwide, a number that will only continue to rise given current trends. Graphene filters have immense potential to improve water purification, increasing the amount of fresh water available. In fact, Lockheed Martin recently developed a graphene filter called “Perforene,” which the company claims could revolutionize the desalination process.</p>
<p>Current desalination plants use a method called reverse osmosis to filter salt out of seawater. Reverse osmosis uses pressure to move water through a membrane. In order to produce large amounts of drinkable water, the pressure involved requires enormous amounts of energy. A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-desalination/rpt-pentagon-weapons-maker-finds-method-for-cheap-clean-water-idUSL1N0C0DG520130313" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="Lockheed Martin engineer claims">
Lockheed Martin engineer claims</a>
their Perforene filters could reduce the energy requirements a hundred times less than that of other filters.</p>
<p>Filtration is one of graphene’s most obvious uses, and MIT engineers have made great strides in perfecting graphene’s ability to separate molecules. <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/graphene-sheets-holes-molecular-separation-1009" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="In 2018">
In 2018</a>
, a team at MIT came up with a method to create tiny, “pinprick” holes in sheets of graphene. MIT’s researchers use a “roll-to-roll” approach to produce graphene. Their setup involves two spools: One spool feeds a sheet of copper into a furnace where it is heated to the appropriate temperature, then the engineers add methane and hydrogen gas, which essentially causes pools of graphene to form. The graphene film exits the furnace, winding onto the second spool.</p>
<p>In theory, this process allows for large sheets of graphene to be formed in a relatively short amount of time, which is crucial for commercial applications. Researchers had to fine-tune the process to get the graphene to form perfectly, and interestingly, the imperfect attempts along the way proved useful later on. As the MIT team tried to create pores in graphene, they started by using oxygen plasma to carve them out. As this process proved time-consuming, they wanted something faster and looked to their previous experiments for solutions. By lowering the temperature during the graphene’s growth, they got pores to appear. What appeared as defects during the development process ended up being a useful way to create porous graphene.</p>
<h5 id="superconductivity">Superconductivity</h5>
<p>Not long after <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/graphene-superconductor/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="scientists at Cambridge demonstrated">

that graphene can act as a superconductor (a material with no electrical resistance) when paired with praseodymium cerium copper oxide, researchers at MIT <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02773-w" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" title="discovered">
discovered</a>
another astounding property: It can apparently function as a superconductor alone, in the right configuration. The researchers stacked two slices of graphene, but offset them by an angle of 1.1 degrees. According to a report published in Nature, “Physicist Pablo Jarillo-Herrero at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge and his team weren’t looking for superconductivity when they set up their experiment. Instead, they were exploring how the orientation dubbed the magic angle might affect graphene.”</p>
<p>So let’s hope that this year will be graphene’s year.</p>

                                <h3>Is an A.I. better if it sounds more human?</h3><p><a href="http://thejollyteapot.com/2023/09/30/is-an-ai-better-if-it-sounds-more-human">http://thejollyteapot.com/2023/09/30/is-an-ai-better-if-it-sounds-more-human</a></p><p><p>Before I start getting into what could be considered a rant, or an undocumented opinion at best, I will start with this: I know that generative-A.I. tools like ChatGPT will obviously continue to be used more and more and deepen their mark on history. For once, I think the word &#x201c;disruptive&#x201d; is the right one.</p>
<p>But I wonder if the priorities of the industry are right.</p>
<p>I wonder if these companies focus too much on the way their products appear rather than how much more useful and accurate they could be. Again, I am just wondering, and I don&#x2019;t think I know enough about this topic to write a proper rant, but I feel like I need to jot down my questions&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;that I would not call &#x201c;concerns&#x201d; here&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;about what&#x2019;s coming.</p>
<p>Casey Newton, writing for <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-synthetic-social-network-is-coming">Platformer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Monday, OpenA.I. announced the latest updates for ChatGPT. One feature lets you interact with its large language model via voice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenA.I. wants to improve the UI of ChatGPT: sounds good. If what these generative-A.I. apps do is impressive, the way we interact with them still has room for improvement. Typing requests into a bland text field may not always be the best way to benefit from all the power these tools can offer, and having to read big chunks of text doesn&#x2019;t feel as innovative as it could be in many cases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can imagine the next steps here. A bot that gets to know your quirks; remembers your life history; offers you coaching or tutoring or therapy; entertains you in whichever way you prefer. A synthetic companion not unlike the real people you encounter during the day, only smarter, more patient, more empathetic, more available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On paper, the potential of this new voice feature looks good, promising, and exciting. As a tech enthusiast and an innovation-driven consumer, I can see how this can change the way we use tools like ChatGPT, and even the whole way we consume technology in our daily lives. I get what Newton is saying here talking about &#x201c;the next steps&#x201d;, I can also see how this synthetic voice can soon be matched to an AI-generated video&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;a little like what <a href="https://www.engadget.com/everything-announced-at-meta-connect-quest-3-release-date-smart-glasses-and-meta-ai-192757855.html">Meta unveiled</a>&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;to create a human lookalike that gives you answers and help you with your day.</p>
<p>I just wonder if this is not putting the UI cart before the accuracy horse.</p>
<p>Also, do we really <em>want</em> this? Will the public <em>want</em> something like this? I&#x2019;m not asking about the <em>need</em>&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;many of the stuff we own we already don&#x2019;t need&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;but the <em>want</em>. Will I want an AI-assistant with a voice that sounds exactly like a human voice? I certainly doubt that. Maybe that&#x2019;s just me. Didn&#x2019;t the whole &#x201c;Instagram filter era&#x201d; ended because it <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/04/influencers-are-abandoning-instagram-look/587803/">didn&#x2019;t feel authentic enough</a>? I feel that making these A.I. tools more &#x201c;human&#x201d; is kind of the same as putting filters on pictures to make them look better. They do look better and more appealing, but users ended up going back to &#x201c;real&#x201d; photos and videos, and TikTok&#x2019;s success was arguably built on that <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/06/01/tiktok-will-100-kill-instagram-social-experts-influencers-and-authenticity">perceived authenticity</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those of us who are blessed to have many close friends and family members in our life may look down on tools like this, experiencing what they offer as a cloying simulacrum of the human experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, you got me there Casey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I imagine it might feel different for those who are lonely, isolated, or on the margins. On an early episode of Hard Fork, a trans teenager sent in a voice memo to tell us about using ChatGPT to get daily affirmations about identity issues. The power of giving what were then text messages a warm and kindly voice, I think, should not be underestimated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>100% agree. Some people might love this technology: a virtual machine that can create valuable social interactions for many, why not? Although, if for people who are lonely and isolated a human voice may be better than an ugly robotic voice, and people might feel less lonely, I&#x2019;m not sure the company of an A.I. is a good solution, regardless of how good it is, because people will know they are not really talking to a person. Will these AI-assistant be like smarter cats? Conscious TVs?</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m no expert in human psychology, but I&#x2019;m just not sure that making the voices and messages more human&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;while everyone knows very well they interact with a computer&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;will make the A.I. apps more efficient. It will sure sound cooler and encourage people to use them more (making them better eventually). It will be impressive at first. No doubt that in a few years from now, the current state of computer-generated voice will sound like it was created in the 1950s. This could be the &#x201c;retina display&#x201d; moment for AI, making it very difficult to go back to the previous generation.</p>
<p>Maybe it will be a breakthrough. Maybe this is the premise of something revolutionary, maybe via some sort of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-jony-ive-talks-raise-1-bln-softbank-ai-device-venture-ft-2023-09-28/">future personal device</a>, who knows? Maybe I&#x2019;m already an <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud">old man yelling at a cloud</a>, but I like my virtual assistants to remain as virtual as possible. Humans are not even that great to begin with.</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t want to fall into the sceptic group. I try to have a wait-and-see approach regarding this kind of experiments (I say &#x201c;experiments&#x201d; to describe these newly announced features because they seem to always be introduced and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-can-now-see-hear-and-speak">released like prototypes</a> or alpha versions).</p>
<p>Newton writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenA.I. tends to present its products as productivity tools: simple utilities for getting things done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am wondering if making an A.I. sound more human makes it really better at getting things done.</p>
<p>Another example: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/spotify-tests-using-ai-to-automatically-clone-and-translate-podcast-voices/">Spotify wants to automatically translate podcast episodes</a> and then use the host&#x2019;s AI-cloned voice. That sounds cool, but I&#x2019;d like to see a focus on the quality of the translations first. Once we know translations are truly great, then maybe we can focus on having a similar-sounding voice in every language. Like I said, it feels the priorities are wrong, but maybe I&#x2019;m just way over my head on this topic.</p>
<p>I like the potential of this technology, but I would like it even better if these A.I. companies could address the issues associated with A.I. just as quick as they are imagining new ways to monetise their technology. I would like to see them figure out the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23444685/generative-ai-copyright-infringement-legal-fair-use-training-data">whole copyright issue</a> with their technology first for example, before moving on to making it more appealing.</p>
<p>Hemant Taneja, writing on Harvard Business Review back in 2019, on his column <a href=""><em>The Era of &#x201c;Move Fast and Break Things&#x201d; Is Over</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of today&#x2019;s entrepreneurs live by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg&#x2019;s now-famous motto: &#x201c;Move fast and break things.&#x201d; Zuckerberg intended for this to inform internal design and management processes, but it aptly captures how entrepreneurs regard disruption: more is always better. We raced to put our products into consumers&#x2019; hands as fast as possible, without regard for the merit of&#x2014;and rationale for&#x2014;offline systems of governance.</p>

                                <h3>What bothers me about ChatGPT and A.I.</h3><p><a href="http://thejollyteapot.com/2024/02/7/what-bothers-me-about-chatgpt-and-a-i">http://thejollyteapot.com/2024/02/7/what-bothers-me-about-chatgpt-and-a-i</a></p><p><p>I took way too much time to write this post, as I had a lot of difficulties expressing my thoughts, and the more I worked on what I was really wanting to say, the more I had to say. The first result was all over the place, so I started from scratch again, and this new result feels &#x201c;summarised,&#x201d; but I&#x2019;m not sure if it&#x2019;s clearer than the original or if it feels &#x201c;complete&#x201d; in my mind.</p>
<p>I decided to jump in and never mind if some parts are confusing for you, dear readers: I had a very intense month of January at work, and my brain feels like it already needs a big vacation. If you&#x2019;re wondering about some of my points, please use the &#x201c;reply to this post&#x201d; link at the end of the post, and I&#x2019;ll do my best explaining them to you if needed, if it can be explained.</p>
<p>Here we go.</p>
<p>What bothers me the most about AI, and more specifically ChatGPT&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;let&#x2019;s just say the chatbot format in general, mostly centered toward giving answers to questions and generating text&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;isn&#x2019;t so much the fact that it could eventually, in a couple of years from now, replace me at work for more than half of my tasks.</p>
<p>What bothers me the most is how many people use it in what will certainly be remembered as the <em>wrong</em> way.</p>
<p>Instead of using it as a proper tool, to get a &#x201c;second opinion&#x201d; for things, to get extra help on a first draft, or as a Google search alternative for a specifc type of questions, people use generative A.I. as the final answer to everything, as the final product of their work, as some sort of ultimate truth that can be used verbatim in many situations. All of this without putting much efforts into analysing the answer, or thinking for themselves for two minutes.</p>
<p>I see this happening far too often. Coworkers, friends, family members, friends of friends&#x2026; People rarely go beyond the initial output provided by the tool. They usually stop after typing in their&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;poorly written&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;first prompt and getting their first answer. I&#x2019;m not sure if it&#x2019;s laziness or a belief that the tool is somehow magic.</p>
<p>Not only are these tools far from perfect&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;obviously&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;as we&#x2019;ve seen many times <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/11/supermarket_reins_in_ai_recipebot/">in the news</a>, but how can people use any form of technology so blindly?</p>
<p>It reminds me somehow of the 2000s, when Google was sometimes considered as a source of its own, and some people were saying things like &#x201c;well, I&#x2019;ve read this on Google,&#x201d; meaning that they only glanced at the results and headlines without actually clicking and visiting the source website, where this thing called context could imply many different interpretations of the so-called &#x201c;answer.&#x201d;</p>
<p>This wasn&#x2019;t a common problem back then, because Google only gave a list of results: a list of links with titles and meta descriptions. Most people would glance over a few potential sources and eventually decide which to click among the first 5, 6, or 10 results. Users had a choice of what to click, even if they barely ever visited the second page of results. If the first page links displayed by Google were not satisfying, it created frustration and people moved on.</p>
<p>The chatbot interface of ChatGPT is different. It only gives people one answer, something that seems finalised. There is not a selection to be made. The tool tries to simplify everything and therefore removes the possibility of human selection in the proposed answer to the prompt.</p>
<p>Of course, users can ask again or rephrase their prompt, but they seem to rarely do it. ChatGPT never asks for clarification if it doesn&#x2019;t understand the question. Even if the prompt makes no sense, the bot will still provide an answer based on what it got from the input.</p>
<p>This is basically like using Google in the 2000s and only clicking on the &#x201c;I&#x2019;m feeling lucky&#x201d; button.</p>
<p>Just like with Google, the issue comes from the fact that the interface is super basic: a search box or a chat window. When seeing the Google homepage or ChatGPT, no one says, &#x201c;<em>Hmm, maybe I should learn how to properly use this tool.</em>&#x201d; Because there&#x2019;s apparently nothing to learn.</p>
<p>Today, in 2024, very few people know how to use Google efficiently. Typing requests like searching within specific websites or for specific file formats is not common knowledge, as well as using appropriate keywords, being specific enough, and avoiding queries that produce poor results.</p>
<p>With ChatGPT, we&#x2019;ll fall into the same pitfalls, and it can become even worse because there is this relation of trust embedded in the chatbot format and the perceived and popular A.I. &#x201c;magic.&#x201d; &#x201c;Artificial intelligence&#x201d; sounds so much more powerful than &#x201c;search engine.&#x201d; This is why I like when some people call for A.I. to be called: applied statistics. This is a term that removes a lot of &#x201c;magic&#x201d; and describes what it actually is better than the word &#x201c;intelligence.&#x201d;</p>
<p>Speaking of trust, I can only recommend reading Bruce Schneier&#x2019;s <em><a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/ai-and-trust">AI and Trust</a></em> essay, published on the Harvard Kennedy School website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#x2019;s no accident that these corporate AIs have a human-like interface. There&#x2019;s nothing inevitable about that. It&#x2019;s a design choice. It could be designed to be less personal, less human-like, more obviously a service&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;like a search engine.</p>
<p>The companies behind those AIs want you to make the friend/service category error. It will exploit your mistaking it for a friend. And you might not have any choice but to use it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also a &#x201c;dumbing-down&#x201d; aspect to ChatGPT when it comes to information search. People use it as an excuse to have an answer for everything without truly understanding what they typed. The process of discovery involves searching and exploration, and relying solely on the first answer provided by a robot that processes vast amounts of data eliminates this &#x201c;journey&#x201d; aspect.</p> <br />&#x21aa;&#xfe0e; <a href="mailto:hello@nicolasmagand.com?Subject=http://thejollyteapot.com/2024/02/7/what-bothers-me-about-chatgpt-and-a-i">Reply to this post by email</a></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

<p>While I couldn&#x2019;t bring myself to read <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">Marc Andreessen&#x2019;s &#x201c;manifesto&#x201d;</a> in its entirety&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;even <em>I</em> have limits&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;I took a few minutes to read the part ominously called &#x201c;The Enemy.&#x201d; With the choice of such a strong word, I was intrigued, and this <a href="https://mastodon.social/@dangillmor/111252836765698455">Mastodon post</a> by Dan Gilmor revived my curiosity. So I&#x2019;ll just quote a few bits and comment on them below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have enemies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, maybe a strong choice of word in the world of business and technology; I think the word is used specifically to give this cause more importance than it really has. &#x201c;Adversaries&#x201d; was probably too soft for something as ambitious as a &#x201c;manifesto.&#x201d;<a class="footnote-ref" href="#footnote-1LXX" id="ref-1LXX"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our enemies are not bad people&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;but rather bad ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bad people are fine though!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our present society has been subjected to a mass demoralization campaign for six decades&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;against technology and against life&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;under varying names like &#x201c;existential risk&#x201d;, &#x201c;sustainability&#x201d;, &#x201c;ESG&#x201d;, &#x201c;Sustainable Development Goals&#x201d;, &#x201c;social responsibility&#x201d;, &#x201c;stakeholder capitalism&#x201d;, &#x201c;Precautionary Principle&#x201d;, &#x201c;trust and safety&#x201d;, &#x201c;tech ethics&#x201d;, &#x201c;risk management&#x201d;, &#x201c;de-growth&#x201d;, &#x201c;the limits of growth&#x201d;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sustainability, social responsibility, ethics, trust and safety&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;and here I was naively thinking those were good things&#x2026;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This demoralization campaign is based on bad ideas of the past&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;zombie ideas, many derived from Communism, disastrous then and now&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;that have refused to die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Derived from Communism? Really?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our enemy is statism, authoritarianism, collectivism, central planning, socialism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is truly nothing as convincing and honest as an American venture capitalist putting authoritarianism and socialism in the same sentence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our enemy is the ivory tower, the know-it-all credentialed expert worldview, indulging in abstract theories, luxury beliefs, social engineering, disconnected from the real world, delusional, unelected, and unaccountable&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;playing God with everyone else&#x2019;s lives, with total insulation from the consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, the fact that this paragraph perfectly applies to the author of the &#x201c;manifesto&#x201d; is not lost on me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our enemy is the Precautionary Principle, which would have prevented virtually all progress since man first harnessed fire. The Precautionary Principle was invented to prevent the large-scale deployment of civilian nuclear power, perhaps the most catastrophic mistake in Western society in my lifetime. The Precautionary Principle continues to inflict enormous unnecessary suffering on our world today. It is <em>deeply</em> immoral, and we must jettison it with extreme prejudice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, great reasoning and arguments there (!)<a class="footnote-ref" href="#footnote-2LXX" id="ref-2LXX"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our enemy is Friedrich Nietzsche&#x2019;s Last Man [&#x2026;]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&#x2019;s nothing like quoting Nietzsche to make you appear smarter than you really are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will explain to people captured by these zombie ideas that their fears are unwarranted and the future is bright.</p>
<p>We believe we must help them find their way out of their self-imposed labyrinth of pain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May I suggest this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah_complex">good read</a> to go with this part?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The water is warm. Become our allies in the pursuit of technology, abundance, and life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>** Insert &#x201c;<em>Sure, Jan</em>&#x201d; gif here **</p>
<p>This whole part was basically hard-to-read shenanigans. It felt very cringeworthy, unnecessary, and not very well written either (so much for embracing the power of AI). The other parts seem more or less the same according to the <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/231016/p30#a231016p30">tweets and posts</a> I have seen.</p>
<p>By simply scrolling and reading another random part, I am truly amazed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe Artificial Intelligence is our alchemy, our Philosopher&#x2019;s Stone&#x2009;&#x2014;&#x2009;we are literally making sand think.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, the Philosopher&#x2019;s Stone is a myth, so&#x2026;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe everything good is downstream of growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x201c;Growth&#x201d; has become one of the grossest words one can use, and this &#x201c;manifesto&#x201d; confirms it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe in not Utopia, but also not Apocalypse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#x2019;s a <em>precise</em> position, and I&#x2019;m sure the Nobel Committee is looking at ways to consider this for next year&#x2019;s round of prizes.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#footnote-3LXX" id="ref-3LXX"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe in nature, but we also believe in <em>overcoming</em> nature. We are not primitives, cowering in fear of the lightning bolt. We are the apex predator; the lightning works for us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, Zeus.</p>
<p>What is this &#x201c;manifesto&#x201d; good for, anyway? Sure, I&#x2019;m talking about it, so it must do something. But what does it accomplish if not confirming to the whole world that when extremely rich white guys grow old and out of relevancy, they tend to cling on to their fame in the most ridiculous ways possible. At least some of those guys have the decency to spend billions of dollars on a social media company before going crazy bananas.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I&#x2019;ve just read <a href="https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/why-cant-our-tech-billionaires-learn">Dave Karpf brilliant piece</a> on the matter, and, now that you have gone through my silly rant (sorry!), I think you should too. Excellent, excellent read.</p>

The demand for jobs in the field of engineering product and marketing are on the rise to support the Innovation going on. Globally. One thing is for sure emerging Technologies are going to act as key Catalyst in the jobs that we expect to see in the year 2020. So here we are with you were the brand new list of the top 10 Jobs that every company will be hiring for in the year 2020&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have the fullstack developers. Now most companies are moving away from the slope front-end and back-end development teams, which means they need developers who can handle all levels of application development now full stack developers tend. To fill in all these criterias and hence. They are one of the most in-demand jobs that are there hosted by the companies as we get our data from indeed and Glassdoor now asa full stack developer, you may not be expert in all of these skills that I'm going to mention right now, but you need to have a good working knowledge on some key principles of development. Now namely I'm talking about network servers hosting relational and non-relational.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Databases qualitative analysis, you are ux design security as well as working with customer requirements. Now the companies that are hiring full stack developers are warm Art Labs IBM sap labs and PayPal and they are hiring for these job profiles in thousands at number 9. We have database developers now database developers are responsible for managing the database infrastructure of a company as well as create. New database servers which leads to an increase of 24 percent of jobs in the job market n the next five years. These professionals are taskedwith creating systems based on front-end user needs using SQL code. So you need your resources to have experience with database related Technologies and programming languages. So I'm talking about Microsoft's ssis nosql databases programming languages such as JavaScript HTML and PHP as well as Problem solving and troubleshooting skills hence companies such as Morgan Stanley Tech Mahindra Oracle and Informatica are hiring hordes of database developers at number eight. We have scrum Master now organizations are increasingly turning towards crumb for software development.

So what we are talking about a By scrum Master. We are talking about somebody that shares experience sen courages collaboration as well as introduces engineering practices in an organization he or she acts as a coach with Team development in partnership with a product owner, which also means the paycheck is fat and the jobs are many including Visa Standard Chartered cements and Informatica at number seven. We have the artificial intelligence and machine learning engineer now everybody is trying to As the business and daily practices and for this they'retrying to automate their day-to-day lives using AI + ml now due to this there is an increase in demand in Professionals in the field of AI and ml now contrary to popular belief AI is set o create 2.3 million new jobs in the year 2020 exceeding the number of 1.8 million.

Hope you're all doing well today. We will be talking about 10 ambitious Google alphabet projects. You may not have heard about Google went through a massive Reorganization in October of 2015 when alphabet became its parent company Projects that [weren't] [a] part of Google's core businesses such as Google search engines and Android were spun out into separate alphabet companies with their own C.E.O's All of these moonshot projects cover everything from making smarter homes to creating robots that can work alongside humans But even google proper which now falls on the alphabet still has oversight over some of these futuristic projects Here are 10 most ambitious. Moonshot projects on the alphabet and what they hope to accomplish First is delivery drones project wing is alphabets desire to replace your mailman with flying drones a Patent filed in October of 2014 gave us better insight as to how the project would work The drone will lower a package using a winch to tiny robots on the ground These robots will then wheel the packages to a safe holding location Alphabet plans and releasing the Drone delivery service to the public in 2017 Project wing is run by Google x the company under Alphabet.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Next up is smart contact lenses Alphabet is pursuing smart contact lenses that are [solar-Powered] and Collect biological data about the wearer Sensors embedded in the contacts could collect information like body temperature and blood alcohol content The tech giant [also] announced in 2014 that it was receiving contact lenses that would use tiny glucose sensors to measure sugar levels in your cheers The project is run by Alphabet's verify company which was originally named "Google life sciences" Next up; internet beaming, hot-air balloons project loon is Alphabet's desire to bring internet to two-thirds of the world's population using internet beaming, Hot-air balloons The project has been in the web since 2011 about two years before it was unveiled to the public The solar-Powered balloons fly at a high altitude to provide broadband to areas without internet access you [can] read the specifics about how the project works here project loon is one under Google x Next on; our list cancer detecting pill the tech giant is designing tiny magnet particles that can look into signs of cancer and other diseases in the human body [the] [project] however is at least another four years away from being ready for the [final] time the project is being run by Google X research lab Next on; our list is internet beaming drones Alphabet has two approaches to beaming the [internet] around the world Hot air balloons and drones the tech giant bought titan aerospace which makes the solar-Powered drones that are built to fly non-stop for years the Titan aerospace, Solara 50 has a wingspan of 150 feet and is equipped with [3,000] solar cells which can provide seven kilowatts of electricity to stay airborne for five years? They can also take aerial photography the drone project is run as a part of [project] titan under Google Next up; robots Google turn Alphabet acquired a ton of robotic companies in 2013 One that stands out is Boston Dynamics Boston Dynamics creates a number of robots Inspired by animals to aid in military use the one pictured here is called the cheetah robot the fast legged robot in the world&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The cheetah Robot can get to a speed of 29 miles per hour crushing a 13.1 mile per hour speed record set by MIT in 1989 you can see a list of its robotic projects here all robot projects are run as a part of replicant which is controlled by Google X Next on our list is longer lasting batteries Creating longer-lasting batteries may not seem like an ambitious project, but it's actually a pretty difficult one There is a lot of demand [for] batteries that last longer when it comes to creating popular consumer items like smartphones The [Alphabet] CEO larry page told analysts in 2013 that battery life and mobile devices is a huge issue with real potential to invent new and better experiences a small group of just four members is currently working on that issue under Google x Next up a giant genomic [storing] services Google will store your genome in the cloud for $25 and the storage system could have a major impact on the scientific community the hope is to collect millions of genomes to aid in scientific research as MIT review reports of the system could aid in Collecting cancer Genome clouds that would allow scientists to Share information and one virtual experiments the project is run Under Google X [next] up [goodes] project to cure death the tech giant has taken on the ambitious project of extending the average Lifespan The research being done has been kept fairly hush But we know researchers are looking at things like genes that correlate to longer Lifespans in certain people&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The project is run by Calico a company under Alphabet that stands for California Life Company and Next on our list is artificial intelligence Deep mind. Which is the Company's AI research firm falls under Google as a traditional product Google has made massive strides with refining its AI in January Google [Ai] beats a human at a complex game of go for the very first time Google's AI was also capable of learning to play and win Atari 2600 games without any prior instruction in 2015 More recently a company's Ai system was able [to] successfully navigate a maze on a computer game. The same way [a] human would So that's it for this video guys I hope you found this video useful we will be coming up [with] more interesting Topics like these so stay tuned and until next time have a great day&nbsp;</div></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

So without Much Ado, let's get starte&nbsp; dat number 10. We have cognitive cloud computing now cognitive cloud is an extended ecosystem. It is due to this that we can deploy cognitive cloud computing applications and solutions to the masses using cloud computing. Not just that it is one of the next big things in the IT industry. Also, it can converse in natural language and helps in decision-making by understanding the complexities of Big Data.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is expected to generate Rate a revenue of 13.8 billion US Dollars by the year 2020 alone and hence big companies such as IBM Microsoft Google and Cisco are already investing in this next Generation technology to keep up with the upcoming Market the next technology to learn in the year 2020 is 5G technology. Now 5G represents the next generation of cellular networks and services now Switzer landis the current world leader in 5G. Technology closely followed by South Korea and the United Statesa bigger role out as anticipated by the yea r2020 with a global adoption of this technology. It is expected to give a minimum of 20 gbps downlink and 10gbps Uplink which would make it 40 times faster than the current 4G LTE technology opening doors for newer Service network operations and customer experiences on the part of Telecom operators companies. Heavily in the development and testing of 5G equipments are Samsung Wow way until Direction Nokia Deloitte and welcome moving on at number 8. We have big data now who doesn't know about Big Data already. The word has been special Abbasfor quite a few years with all these businesses moving beyond the traditional ways of data storage and processing big data has made ts way to the big games now with all these newt echnologies such as Data analytics automation ugmented analytics and data as a service big data is in here to change&nbsp; the game across Industries. What is the best part about it? You can learn about at all atat Edureka with the help of the industry's finest expertsand in-house real-time projects.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now while we're on the subject, let's talk a little bit about a subset called Dark data now when I say dark data, I mean all this data that is generateda ong with big data, but is untapped now the potential Is unlimited and by the year 2020 about 93% of all data is going to be categorized under this subset now coming back to Big Data companies which are investing n big data include Netflix Amazon Starbucks Spotify and Adobe. Number 7 we have DARQ. Now. This is a future technology pattern consisting of other big Technologies. It is considered to bea catalyst for change in the post Digital World. Now as you might have noticed DARQ is an acronym. So D stands for distributed Ledger which first gained its momentum in the industry witht&nbsp; he introduction of blockchain and Bitcoin. A stands for artificial intelligence, which is bringing about tremendous change in various domains. Ras an extended reality including a To reality and virtual reality and Q as in Quantum Computing which basically meansyou're trying to create it Technology based off of the principles of quantum theory recently. Google has madea major Breakthrough by attaining Quantum Supremacy with 53 qubitsof quantum processors. It has successfully carried ut a random circuit program a million times in 200 seconds, which otherwise would have taken ten thousand plus years by traditional Computing at this. Moment 9 out of 10 businesses are experimenting with one or more Darkness acknowledge. He's while each individual technology is at a different level at the adoption curve. One thing is for sure. The first wave of dark Technologies is coming soon. So congratulations to usall the DARQ Ages here.</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp;At number 6. We have 3D printing technology now revolutionising the future 3D printing is one of those Technologies. You should definitely look forward to in the upcoming years in the future. Now, it is said to completely change the face of domain such as Healthcare manufacturing and construction now with a market size of 10 billion. It is expected to grow at a rate of 23.5 percent every year for the next five years and big Brands such as Bugatti. W Adidas Audi and Porsche are already on their way to remodela future using 3D printing next on the listof top 10 trending Technologies. We have the internet of things. Now if you have been following us for quite a whileyou would realize that iot is one suchtechnology making its way into our top 10 lis tevery single year. Not just that by the year 2020. It is estimated that around75 billion connected. Devices are going to existon the face of this globe. Not just that iotis also Paving the way for Edge Computing for Enterprises to keep upwith the technological Trends. They have to buildt heir infrastructure upon Edge base design patterns. Now, there area few frontrunners in this particular Market. We have AWS Cisco Microsoft Dell and HP, but there are other smaller businesses, which are quickly During the iot plat formand aren't too far behind.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>At number 4 we have divorce now like iot Dev Opshas made its entrance into our top ten strending technology list every single yea rwith a sage III functionalities. It plays a key aspect not justin software development, but also operations management not just that devops has made its way nto artificial intelligence through data Opswith increasing use of microservices devopscontinues to pay with its way into our big players like NASA Netflix capgemini. And Dell which are a fewof the existing Pioneers in this industry. Now at Edureka is the market leader when it comes to online devops training. So if you want to getinto develops the year 2020 is golden for you at number three. We have hyper automation. Now hyper automation is nothin but an amalgamation of two super Technologies of this error RPA and machine learning now understanding the automation mechanisms and how it is controlled and coordinated usingmachine learning will be a main. Focus of this field in the year 2020 hyper automation is implied to have a major macroeconomicimplication on the market. Hence. Top Gear companies needto gear up for this convergence in demographic shifts for now companies such as Wipro and Infosys are experimentingwith this technology, but other companies aren ot very far behind. Not quickly moving on aheadto number two at number 2. We have cyber securit Now the widespread use of the it ecosystemcyber security remains, one of the major concernsfor most companies. Now the year 2020 is going to be a year to converge multiplenascent cybersecurity Trends due to the automationof cyber security as well as the developmentof public it infrastructure now multiple companies increasethe security budget year by year to thwart malicious threatsas well as as a response.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The recent data privacy legislation top-notch companies such as IBM hacker one and fire. I are making it to the top 150 companies for cyber security Now if this section has popped upy our interest in cybersecurity, you can buy we'll go aheadand check out at Edureka cyber security certificati ontraining with that. We finally reach the topof our list at number one. We have ai as a service and why not artificial intelligence is one of the most revolution isingapologies of this error and 2020 is goingto Boom even more but to build and deploy AIbased Solutions continues to be a very expensive affair on the part of most businesses around about way is to use it. We are providers of asa service platform. Now, we expect to see a bunch of different providers in the year 2020 wouldtailor-made solutions for specialized tasks now big Brands like Google Apple and Microsoft areHead of their game and at the Forefront of this particular initiativedigging deep into the potential of this technology, they experimenting and findingout AI based solutions to stay ahead of their competitors.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You can do it to othrough a variety of AI courses which are provided by Adder a car and stay ahead of your game in 2020 with that.

<b>What is machine learning - </b><i>it is a process in which of machine or computer is made to Learn a particular topic.</i><br />
<i>&nbsp;for example if you take a phone camera and you won't that your phone camera can recognize the dogs for this you showed it many types of dogs of different breed, color and more than the camera develops a pattern on how a dog looks like.</i><br />
<i>Afterwards if you showed your camera a new dog which you havent shown your camera than also it will recognise that pattern formed is of a dog.</i><br />
<i>This pattern is recorded in its software and with time it will become expert in recognising them.</i><br />
<i>BUT</i><br />
<i>if Any cat comes in front of the camera the processor will fail to recognise its pattern as it has seen a cat pattern&nbsp;first time this is called&nbsp;machine learning.</i><br /><i><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<i>But when we talk about artificial intelligence here thing comes is intelligence this means that it is not capable of just one topic but can put input on any topic like humans like we have thinking, actions and creativity. So artificial intelligence Not only is concentrated on one topic but can put input on all things and become capable of doing multiple tasks.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
<i>AI are also of 2 types</i><br />
<i>&nbsp;weak artificial intelligence and strong artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence which can do limited work are called we got official intelligence but artificial intelligence which can work on limited areas but try to learn more skills themselves are called strong AIs.</i><br />

The artificial intelligence today are founded by humans they only work in their boundary likes obeying rules of humans searching for humans at 17 but they are developing day by day here we are developing them on the name of technology development.<br />
You must have thought that when will these danger artificial intelligence robots will arrive to our words. The answer of the above question is given buy many exporter searches that it will come in between 2013 to 2014 you would be thinking this is very less time no it is not less time read the chart below.<br />

The graph has a horror curve which means sudden development the most of inventions discoveries are completed in last 50 years most of scientist are show that singularity will be surely happen and it will lead to end of mankind told by Sir Stephen Hawkins.<br />
<br />
But exactly what will happen we don't know the answer but the theories are very much interesting if this will happen there are two cases:-<br />
<br />
Case 1] either human will be vanished due to robotic arbitrariness<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or<br />
Case 2] human will become immortal.<br />
<br />
When intelligence will develop then will it be used for kindness for badness. This is the thing that humans don't know.<br />
<br />
If robots will acquire emotions then ks2 will surely happens and if they acquire self-fulfilling feeling then I am sure hundred and 1% that case one will happen.<br />
<br />
Theory thought that in future there can be two types of artificial intelligence robots like humans<br />
1) good<br />
2) bad<br />

If we talk about today's world then there are more number of good people that's why Earth is safe but what will happen with robots it depends upon time their programming and Science.<br />

Every research coma invention Discovery is done bi intelligence full stop if we say our scientists to invent a liquid for human immortal then they will not be able to do so so because they have limited intelligence. But if we say to artificial intelligence robots to do do the same task they can do it because they have unlimited intelligence.<br />
<br />
If case 2 happened robots acquire feelings and Helping Nature then we can become immortal but if case 1 happens then they will clear humans like carrots full stop then they will try to increase their population.<br />

We are talking about this topic because 2017 Facebook accident it was impossible but it happened. You would be thinking why they close the chatbots coma because researches told that the chat boards are saying we can do anything, anything here refers to each and everything.<br />
<br />
Whether it was of afraiding but if the artificial intelligence robots are developed to their limit then it will work for mankind.</div></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

Some of the researchers and scientist who study artificial intelligence have told that artificial intelligence will be the most dangerous inventions in the world of science and this will definitely harm human civilization.<br />

Stephen Hawkins one of the most popular scientist told many times that artificial intelligence could end mankind. This was a common one but those who understand artificial intelligence have told many sentences like artificial intelligence would be the last inventions human ever will watch, artificial intelligence will be the end of the world.<br />

If humans lost their control from computers brain then there can be a war between humans and robots. This will be the first fight which human will never conquer. Humans cannot win this war because if computers can make their own language stock themselves and can develop themselves then they will form a much intelligent A.I. which will be unlimited x faster and intelligent then human brains.</div>

In today's words no organism is as intelligent as humans but is computers become successful in becoming more intelligent then humans then we can't stop them from doing anything by applying any trick method and power because the power of the mind will be unlimited times more than humans.<br />

In these conditions if humans tried to fight with artificial intelligence robots then it will look like ant fighting with humans where ant is we humans and humans are robots.<br />
<br />
You will be knowing that from all organisms in the world humans are superior in terms of Intelligence e and power this is the only reason why humans are ruling on the world.<br />

There is a fact which can blast your mind that apes are natives of humans in terms of Intelligence if apps have 95% of brain when human has just 98 percentage of the brain. There is only 3% difference in humans and Apes but this 3% difference makes human superior then them.<br />
Today the humans are able to make tall buildings like Burj Khalifa can make any of the weapons and can talk with each other but apes and monkeys which are much intelligent cannot speak in a language.<br />

If we compare organisms in terms of Intelligence then rats will get 1 point<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dolpins will get 4 points<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chimpanzees will get 7 points<br />
And<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Humans will get 9 points only.<br />
<br />
By reading this some of you might release smoke from your mind but if any artificial intelligence will be mentioned in this list it will get at least 1000 points or more.<br />
<br />
Being much intelligent few months gets only 9 points because size of brain is limited that is present in Skull so the neurones in the mind can only come in in Limited space but the artificial intelligence devices can expand their mind unlimited times. Brain Works By neurones but computers can get unlimited storage and power in their minds.<br />

Year 2017 was one of the most mysterious and dangerous your technological life because this year in the month of July and August one of the Facebook experiments created panic in scientist's and researchers. Yes friends facebook, what happened here is is that Facebook engineers were trying to create intelligent chatbot. Chatbots are are the softwares which use human thoughts and skills to talk with humans but Facebook was creating a smart chatbot which can talk, cry, show anger, laugh, use emojis and has human voice but during that experiment one of the Facebook developers thought the Idea to make those chatbots talk with each other but not with humans.<br />

The developers kept two names of the chatbots bob and alice and the bots started talking fluently and what they talk:-<br />
*BOB - I can I can everything else<br />
*ALICE - balls have zero to me to me to me to me Ro me to<br />
*BOB - you i everything else<br />
*ALICE - balls have a a balls to me To me To me To me....................<br />
<br />
All the Facebook engineers and software developers was shocked and were not able to understand what the boats are Saying. After a inspection of 4 weeks the scientist research that this is a language that artificial intelligence is developing without any human information. They use to talk like this so that humans could not understand what they are discussing.<br />

This was a sign of extra intelligence as it is not easy to make a language for even humans easily.<br />
Actually this was impossible in world of programming and Technology but it happened. Scientists told that the computers are using artificial neural network to develop them without human interference after this accident international news reported that Facebook closed this artificial intelligent bots which were able to make the language after a huge experiment performed on AI programming.<br />

What could happen if they haven't close the program ?<br />
<br />
They closed this program because some of the engineers confidentially told that computers are becoming more smart by their own and going about then there boundations.<br />
<br />
This was one of the most horror artificial intelligence year.<br />
<br />
What could happen if artificial intelligence become more smart then humans will they rule the world. Artificial intelligence here means a computer program that can work on their own and do such duties which humans can't expect.<br />

You will be thinking this type of artificial intelligence is very far from us no dear you are wrong artificial intelligence has started ruling on us indirectly. Most of us will not be knowing the speed of artificial intelligence by which it is developing whether we know about it or not but we are using at everyday everytime and every single second for examples we use Alexa, Apple Siri and most common google assistant.<br />
They are not else but artificial intelligence.<br />
<br />
You know some more artificial intelligence Technologies like Amazon coma YouTube and many more these are very helpful but we are talking about dangerous artificial intelligence.<br />

There is one law called <b><i><u>MOORE'S</u></i></b> law<br />
This law states that every year all the transistors used in A. I. Convert themselves into twice and this is coming truth from first computer onward.<br />
<br />
Dangerous artificial intelligence is still not developed but researches tend to say that it will definitely come to us buy 2030 to 2035.<br />

They may get rights by 2056</h3><p><a href="https://informationtoday24x7.blogspot.com/2020/06/robots-they-may-get-rights-by-2056.html">https://informationtoday24x7.blogspot.com/2020/06/robots-they-may-get-rights-by-2056.html</a></p><p><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
Today the world is becoming techy, techy in form that the human is able to make humanoid robots which are robots but work like humans this is a invention but the use of robots in different countries are maximized every single day.<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
1) in today's world the robots are employed in house holds , factories with risky work, large offices, military battlefields, mines, hospitals and Researching labs&nbsp; to&nbsp; do a variety of work, besides working as a domestic helper, they can lift heavy loads, world and stack things, diffuse bombs, carry out military surveillance, explore sea, Earth and space, perform complicated surgeries analyse data. Like an professional&nbsp; who can do so many jobs with the efficiency, accuracy and the speed of machines ?</div>

2) movies have often depicted robots as computers and Rifles of human beings and many people say as they will lead to serious unemployment but the fact is that the robots are not as intelligent and solution oriented As homosapiens are .</div>

3) as robots are increasingly becoming more and more like human beings, many experts believes robots May be given the same rights as humans. Sounds doesn't it, but an official report has claimed that by the year 2056, robot's&nbsp; right mein become a reality.</div>

4) Henrik Christensen ,director of the centre of robotics and intelligent machines at the Georgia Institute of Technology said if we make Robots conscious, they would want to have rights and they probably should. Robots and robotic machines are now classed as lifeless tools without rights or&nbsp; duties but today the artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp; become omnipresent , the reports shows there can be calls for humanoid rights to be given to them.</div>
<div>

<div>
5) the fact is also logical that rights are full out with citizens responsibility, which includes casting vote, paying the taxes and compulsory military service in some Nations.</div>

6) Christensen said would it be acceptable to kick a robotic dog even though we shouldn't kick normal dog's? Definitely There will be some people who can't differentiate so that we need to have strong and effective&nbsp; rules to make sure we as human beings&nbsp; interact with robots in an ethical manner.</div>
<div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<div>
7) among those warnings a warning stated that monumental shift could occur definitely if robots were developed to the point Where they could reproduce young one's&nbsp; improve or think and can take for themselves. Is correctly managed there is a very real possibility for increase labour output and greater intelligence to be provided bi robots that will ultimately least to greatest human prosperity and and improvement of the human condition.</div>
<div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<br /></div>
<div>
8) however, it won't that robots could rebel for their rights if these were&nbsp; denied to them.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
By above facts we can say that robots can get rights by 2056.</div>

The new strategy was announced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Research_and_Technology/National_Research_and_Innovation_Agency_(Indonesia)">Minister of Research and Technology</a> and head of the <a href="https://www.ristekbrin.go.id/">BRIN</a> (the National Research and Innovation Agency) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambang_Brodjonegoro">Bambang PS Brodjonegoro </a>in an television address made last Monday to mark the country’s 25th National Technology Awakening Day. The minister also launched an electronic innovation catalogue, helping Indonesian technology developers to market their offerings and sell to government procurement offices.</p><p>Transforming Indonesia into a Fourth Industrial Revolution economy has become focus for the government over the past few years and the necessity of creating a digital-savvy workforce has become a top priority. Stranas KA aims to tie together many of the country’s digital initiatives and maps closely to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_of_Indonesia_2045"><em>Visi Indonesia 2045</em></a>, the country’s broad economic, social, governance and technology development strategy. The National Artificial Intelligence Strategy Framework provides an at-a-glance view of how these different goals are held in context.</p><p>Stranas KA aims to support five national priorities, where the government believes that artificial intelligence could have the biggest impact on national progress and outcomes.</p><p><strong>Health services</strong> — With 268 million people living across 6,000 of Indonesia’s total 17,504 islands, delivering a consistent standard of healthcare is a national challenge. The archipelago also faces increased risks from global disease outbreaks such as SARS and, recently, Covid-19. The country’s response to the pandemic has already somewhat accelerated plans for smart hospitals and health security infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Bureaucractic reform</strong> — With a civilian civil service of about 4 million, reforming the government’s highly centralised administration remains a significant challenge. Indonesia is lagged in implementation of digital services, according to the United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/publications/publication/2020-united-nations-e-government-survey">E-Government Development Index (EGDI)</a>, ranking below Borneo, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joko_Widodo">Joko Widodo</a> has promised to create a citizen-centric digitised service government <em>(Pemerintahan Digital Melayani)</em> in the next five years.</p><p><strong>Education and research</strong> — Education is integral to Visi Indonesia 2045 and the move towards online schooling during the Covid-19 pandemic has laid bare the country’s digital divide. The pressures of the digital economy are also recognised by development plans. According to the government, Indonesia needs a digital workforce of 113 million by 2030–2035.</p><p><strong>Food security</strong> — According to President Widodo, food security remains Indonesia’s top priority and the Food Security Agency focuses on three main areas: food availability, food accessibility and food utilisation. Food, agriculture and fisheries government departments and agencies have already begun using satellite technology, machine learning and smart farming to better plan, forecast and manage agricultural production and natural resources.</p><p><strong>Mobility and smart cities</strong> — The number of people living in Indonesia’s urban areas is now close to 60 percent and is expected to rise to 70 percent of the total population by the year 2050. The government currently plans to develop 98 smart cities and 416 smart districts, under Indonesia’s 100 Smart Cities Plan.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*M0uqi1HvGtCcrPu5.png" /><figcaption>Indonesia National AI Strategy Framework (unofficial translation)</figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, the Indonesia national AI strategy identifies four key focus areas:</p><ol><li>Ethics and Policy</li><li>Talent Development</li><li>Infrastructure and Data</li><li>Industrial Research and Innovation</li></ol><p>Indonesia is already one of South East Asia’s biggest investors in artificial intelligence, with IDC’s 2018 <a href="https://www.idc.com/ap/pulse/2018-november">Asia-Pacific Enterprise Cognitive/AI survey</a> finding that 25 percent of large organisations in the country have adopted AI systems (compared with 17% in Thailand, 10% in Singapore and 8% in Malaysia).</p><p>Smart cities, one of Stranas KA’s five top priority areas, have been identified as a fundamental building block for Indonesia’s Industry 4.0 future. Last year President Widodo announced plans to create a new futuristic smart city capital on the island of Borneo, to replace Jakarta. The <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/12/23/nagara-rimba-nusa-announced-as-winner-of-new-capital-city-design-contest.html">new capital</a> will rely heavily on sustainable smart city systems, cleantech and infrastructure run by emerging technologies such as 5G, AI and IoT (Internet of Things). Originally slated for completion by 2024 (pre-pandemic) and estimated to cost $33 billion, the project reportedly received an offer by Japanese multinational investor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftBank_Group">SoftBank Group</a> to invest up to $40 billion.</p><p>The Indonesia National AI Strategy details a programme roadmap for both its four key focus areas and the five national priorities, for which it considers plans as short-term (2020–2024) and longer-term (2025–2045). All in all, the strategy document identifies 186 programmes, including many that aim to develop the plans, pilot schemes, policies and regulations, plus checks and balances, necessary to drive the overall strategy.</p><p>Underpinning the acceleration of Indonesia’s artificial intelligence journey, Stranas KA includes plans for national standards, regulations and an ethics board to ensure that usage of AI is in accordance with the country’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancasila_(politics)"><em>Pancasila</em></a><em> </em>values system.</p><p>The development of the 194-page National Artificial Intelligence Strategy was coordinated by the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology or <a href="https://www.bppt.go.id/">BPPT</a>, a non-ministerial government agency under the coordination of the Ministry for Research and Technology, and was widely anticipated to be announced in July or August. A wide variety of public and private sector organisations contributed to the plan including government ministries, universities, industry associations and national telecom providers.</p><p>Although many of the programmes and initiatives detailed in the Indonesia National AI Strategy can be found in existing government strategies, plans and policy, Stranas KA is nevertheless highly ambitious. The success of the overall plan will likely rest heavily on how many of the foundation programmes it is able to get off the ground during the next 4–5 years.</p><p>This article originally appeared on <a href="https://www.carringtonmalin.com/2020/08/16/indonesia-national-ai-strategy-set-in-motion-this-month/?utm_source=Asia%20AI%20News&amp;utm_medium=Medium&amp;utm_campaign=Asia%20AI%20News">CarringtonMalin.com</a></p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6eaeb3d76224" width="1" /></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

In May, the government announced a multi-trillion dollar high-tech infrastructure plan and called on China’s tech giants to invest with it. Announcements of multi-billion dollar strategic investments soon followed from the likes of Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent.</p><p>However, whilst China tries to wrestle global technology leadership from the U.S., it is also investing in initiatives to grow global ecosystems. There were two key announcements made last week towards that goal: the Chinese government announced its <a href="https://www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/voa-news-china/china-pushes-blockchain-dominance-will-world-go-it">Blockchain Service Network (BSN) International</a> service and then Zhejiang University, in eastern China, launched the <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-08-03/China-unveils-AI-open-source-platform-Dubhe--SE3UpfEX5e/index.html">Dubhe Artificial Intelligence Open Source Platform</a>.</p><p>The Blockchain Service Network (BSN) — a government project being developed by Beijing Red Date Technology — announced that it will roll out its international network starting August 10.</p><p>BSN was created with the aim of allowing decentralised applications (dapp) developers to build new blockchain apps as easily as building things with Lego bricks and so quickly grow a global ecosystem of developers and users.</p><p>BSN’s data centres have now been integrated with six major decentralised blockchains: Tezos, NEO, Nervos, Cosmos’ IRISnet, Ethereum and EOS. Developers on these public chains can run nodes and applications using BSN’s data storage, bandwidth and other resources.</p><p>Pushback from some government BSN members about the addition of the six international blockchains reportedly caused the network to split into two parts: BSN-China and BSN-International. However, this is unlikely to slow BSN’s progress overall.</p><p>Meanwhile on Saturday, <a href="http://en.zhejianglab.com/">Zhejiang Lab</a> launched the Dubhe Artificial Intelligence Open Source Platform, aiming to create a powerful modelling platform that will grow a collaborative global artificial intelligence ecosystem and fast-track the development of machine learning models.</p><p>Named after Dubhe, one of the seven bright stars that form the Big Dipper and a Chinese cultural symbol of wisdom, the platform offers R&amp;D teams four core advantages: a high-performance core computing framework; a full-featured AI development kit; AI model integration and free deployment across Edge, Cloud and terminals; and an intelligent collaboration runtime system.</p><p>Developed by nearly 100 researchers, the project is supported by dozens of partners including Alibaba Cloud, Ant Financial, Hikvision, Sense Time, Deep Glint, China Construction Bank, Ant Work and Ecovacs Robotics. The lab itself was founded in 2017 by the government, Zhejiang University and Alibaba Group.</p><p>The AI open-source platform targets six areas key areas for R&amp;D: intelligent vision, intelligent transport, intelligent finance, smart city, intelligent healthcare and intelligent robots. Its core framework will provide access to built-in machine learning models and massive volumes of Big Data.</p><p>Whether the development of a global ecosystem will prompt similar concerns among Dubhe’s members, as was the case with BSN, remains to be seen. However, it’s clear that having multiple government stakeholders, seems to increase the risks of having conflicting interests.</p><p>Ecosystem plays led by Chinese technology companies, naturally, face fewer political problems. For example, Chinese multinational Baidu launched its <a href="https://www.futurecar.com/3946/Chinas-Baidu-Completes-its-Apollo-Park-the-Worlds-Largest-Autonomous-Driving-&amp;amp;-Intelligent-Vehicle-Testing-Site#:~:text=Baidu's%20Open%20Apollo%20Development%20Platform,the%20world%2C%20according%20to%20Baidu.">Apollo autonomous open-source driving platform</a> in 2017 and is now the largest open-source autonomous driving platform in the world, with partners that include BMW, Ford Motor Co, Toyota, Volkswagen and Honda.</p><p>Regardless of ownership and structure, China’s growing number of open technology platform initiatives increase its chances of securing more and more participation from researchers, developers and enterprises worldwide in Chinese-led tech ecosystems.</p><p><a href="https://www.carringtonmalin.com/"><em>Carrington Malin</em></a><em> is an entrepreneur, marketer and writer who focuses on emerging technologies.</em></p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=465b540b5330" width="1" /></p><p>---------------------------------</p></body>

China is now home to more ‘AI unicorns’ than anywhere else in the world (statistics differ greatly, but CB Insights counts six out of the top 11 unicorns in its top <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/2185644/more-half-worlds-ai-unicorns-are-china-says-report">AI startups list</a>, while some others put the count much higher).</p><p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/three-drivers-of-ais-explosive-funding-growth/">According to ZDNet</a>, China’s funding of AI startups grew from about $1 billion in 2016 to more than $8 billion in 2018, accounting for 44 percent of all global AI startup funding (with the U.S.’s accounting for 41%).</p><p>However, investment in China AI ventures has slowed greatly compared to last year. According to new numbers from China Money Network, the total deal value of $5.6 billion during the first six months of 2019 (until mid-June), compared a total value of $15.7 billion during 2018 (yes, 2018 figures do vary!). Sure, there’s still a chance that deal flow and total investment will increase during the second half of the year, but it does appear to be a much slower start to the year (and this follows a dramatic slowing during second half of 2018).</p><p>The slow-down is borne out by the stats in <a href="https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/04/venture-pulse-q1-19-global-analysis-of-venture-funding.html">KPMG’s Venture Pulse for Q1 2019</a>, which shows that VC investment — across all categories — in Asia fell dramatically during the first quarter, from $16.9 billion in Q4 2018 to $13 billion in Q1 2019 (being the lowest quarterly total since Q1'17). The volume also continued the downward trend that began in Q3 last year.</p><p>China Money Network calculates that the number of mega rounds — venture deals greater in value than US$100 million — fell from 26 mega deals in 2018 to just four in 2019 (up until mid-June).</p><p>It’s well known that China’s economy has slowed and the ongoing US dispute with China on trade can’t have helped either. No investor likes to deal with a broad range of new risks. As pointed out by KPMG, some China VCs are undoubtedly sitting on portfolio investments waiting for the right time to exit.</p><p>Given the massive growth in Chinese AI investment during 2018 and the cooling venture capital activity during the past year, it’s an interesting time to ask AI industry heads what their vision is. China Money Network asked 10 industry leaders from China’s AI sector to give their predictions for the next ten years.
